|-------|-------|
| **Claim ID** | 68 |
| **Character** | Kai-Koumou |
| **Book** | In Search of the Castaways |

### Claim Text

> At ten, migrating with his clan, a flame-shaped birth-mark on his forehead convinced elders he was the reincarnation of the “sun-devouring warrior.” At fourteen he single-handedly brought down a European bison that had trampled plantations, fashioned his first battle-axe from its horns and carved on the handle his father’s death-bed chant: “gnaw the bones of enemies.”

>  under cover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to abandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent plan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a flight across these unknown regions could afford.
