## 🎯 Verdict

❌ **CONTRADICTED**

**Confidence:** [█████████░] 95%

Contradiction (temporal): The claim states that Faria was branded a Jacobin plotter out to poison King John VI and fled conservatives' pursuit. However, the evidence contradicts this by stating that Faria remained in his cell and this visit only increased the belief in his insanity.

Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for.
