In fact, Paganel was able to escape from the pah after the death of Kara-Tété by taking advantage of the confusion of the natives and escaping with Robert Grant. He was not a prisoner but was attached to the chief Hihy by strong flaxen ropes for three days. During their absence, Paganel found dry moss in sufficient quantity and kindled a fire without difficulty using his telescope. There is no evidence of Paganel insisting on travelling light or leaving the team short of supplies."
