  "reasoning": "Evidence from three passages in the book 'In search of the castaways' supports the claim that Tom Ayrton was born near Exeter to a fisherman father, retired naval petty-officer James Ayrton; his mother died young and he was reared by his elder brother Benjamin, learning tides and wind signs on fishing trips while secretly studying the Nautical Almanac and dreaming of 'conquering the seas.'"
