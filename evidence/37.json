The quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the two sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his provisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin. He ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold Bay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could place entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to send a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had been looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he wrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton, but it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a thunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a revolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into which this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious convict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of the wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and it was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but slightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on Lady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout sides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their rifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had joined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain Mangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports suddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence succeeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still curling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of gastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the great trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen, and a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like a prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a formidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should prefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in the open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes around the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the edge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a single convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a flock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to inspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the watch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the centre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other every hour. Lady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's wound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's bullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling her emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart. Here the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major perceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other injury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled considerably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and fore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his wound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations followed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping guard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the major was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of a band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of Victoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her the number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at Seymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben Joyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a wide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster Ayrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major explained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or three almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between the quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation to pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the Duncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his care, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these facts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had transpired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of shrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near the suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile from the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays through the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the ground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station. \"Here they are,\" said one. \"Yes,\" replied another, \"here is the trefoil of the hoofs again.\" \"It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra.\" \"All the horses are dead.\" \"The poison is not far away.\" \"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This gastrolobium is a useful plant.\" \"Then they were silent,\" added MacNabb, \"and departed. I wanted to know more: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning man, this",

At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate would be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain, if you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his intended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their places beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain Mangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered so severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did not yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a profound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his teeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing displayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord Glenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently waited to be questioned: \"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the Duncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick blush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the shame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to command as master, and his fate was soon to be decided. However, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still persisted in maintaining an obstinate silence. \"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan. The convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly contracted. At last he said, in a calm voice: \"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be taken. Do what you please.\" [Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.] Having given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward the coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound indifference for all that was passing around him. You would have thought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair. But Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged him to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life, especially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore resumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the most perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart. \"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer certain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call you Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\" Ayrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question. Glenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to question him. \"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in Australia?\" There was the same silence, the same obstinacy. \"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to speak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For the last time, will you answer my questions?\" Ayrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the face. \"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to prove against me.\" \"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan. [Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.] \"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone. \"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge in Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can say why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to inform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the police, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are at liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime, but even with a culpable action?\" [Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.] Ayrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his former indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would end the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said: \"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my business. It is important that our respective positions should be clearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the part of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a word, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\" Ayrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent. \"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan. \"No, my lord.\" \"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\" \"Certainly not.\" \"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at least, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who are only waiting for a word from your lips?\" The quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low voice, he muttered: \"I cannot, my lord.\" Then, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added, angrily: \"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\" \"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of indignation. But finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice: \"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place you shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\" \"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster. Thereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and two sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his movements. The witnesses of this scene retired",

He had left Dundalk, where he was poor, and, emigrating with his family to Australia, had landed at Adelaide. At first he engaged in mining, but soon relinquished this for the less hazardous pursuits of the farmer, in which he had been successful beyond his highest anticipations. His agricultural knowledge was a great aid to him. He economized, and bought new lands with the profits of the first. His family flourished, as well as his farm. The Irish peasant had become a landed proprietor, and, although his establishment was only two years old, he owned at that moment five hundred acres of well-cultivated land and five hundred head of cattle, was his own master, and as independent as one can be even in the freest country in the world. His guests congratulated him sincerely when his story was finished. He doubtless expected a similar confidence, but did not urge it. Glenarvan had an immediate interest in speaking of the Duncan, of his own presence at Cape Bernouilli, and of the search that they had pursued so perseveringly. But, like a man who considers the main object in view, he first questioned his host concerning the shipwreck of the Britannia. The Irishman's answer was not cheering. He had never heard of the ship. No vessel had for some time been lost on the coast; and, as the shipwreck had occurred only two years before, he could affirm with absolute certainty that the sailors had not been cast on that part of the western shore. \"And now, my lord,\" added he, \"may I be allowed to ask why you have inquired of me concerning this shipwreck?\" Glenarvan then told the story of the document, the voyage of the Duncan, and the attempts made to find Captain Grant. He confessed that his dearest hopes had been destroyed by Mr. O'Moore's discouraging information, and that he now despaired of ever finding the shipwrecked seamen of the Britannia. These words produced a gloomy impression upon his hearers. Robert and Mary listened to them with tearful eyes. Paganel could not find a word of consolation or hope. Captain Mangles suffered a grief that he could not subdue. Despair was seizing upon the souls of the noble people whom the Duncan had vainly brought to these distant shores, when all at once a voice was heard:-- \"My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is living, he is in Australia.\" CHAPTER XXXI. THE QUARTERMASTER OF THE BRITANNIA. The astonishment that these words produced cannot be described. Glenarvan sprang to his feet, and, pushing back his chair, cried,-- \"Who says that?\" \"I!\" replied one of O'Moore's workmen, seated at the end of the table. \"You, Ayrton?\" said the colonist, no less astonished than Glenarvan. \"I,\" repeated Ayrton, in an excited but firm tone; \"I, a Scotchman like yourself, my lord, one of the shipwrecked sailors of the Britannia!\" [Sidenote: A FRESH FACE.] Mary Grant, half fainting with emotion, and overcome with happiness, sank into the arms of Lady Helena; while Captain Mangles, Robert, and Paganel went towards the man whom their host had called Ayrton. He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man, of about forty-five, of more than medium height, and with piercing eyes sunk deeply beneath his projecting brows. His strength must have been unusual, even considering his stature, for he was all bone and sinew. His countenance, full of intelligence and energy, although the features were stern, prepossessed one in his favor. The sympathy that he elicited was still more increased by the traces of recent hardships imprinted upon his face. It was evident that he had suffered much, although he seemed a man able to brave, endure, and conquer suffering. The travelers felt all this at first sight. Ayrton's appearance had interested them; and Glenarvan, acting as spokesman for all, pressed him with inquiries. This strange meeting had evidently produced a bewildering effect, and the first questions were, to some extent, without order. \"You are one of the sailors of the Britannia?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Yes, my lord; Captain Grant's quartermaster,\" replied Ayrton. \"Saved with him from the shipwreck?\" \"No, my lord. At that terrible moment I was washed overboard and cast ashore.\" \"You are not one of the sailors, then, of whom the document makes mention?\" \"No; I did not know of the existence of such a document. The captain must have thrown it overboard after I was gone.\" \"But the captain, the captain?\" \"I suppose he was lost, drowned, with the rest of the crew. I thought I was the sole survivor.\" \"But you said that Captain Grant was living!\" [Illustration: He was a somewhat rough-looking, broad-shouldered man, of about forty-five.] [Illustration: \"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not two cable-lengths distant.\"] \"No. I said, 'if the captain is living'----\" \"'He is in Australia,' you added.\" \"He can be nowhere else.\" \"You do not know, then, where he is?\" \"No, my lord. I repeat that I thought he was buried in the waves or dashed upon the rocks. You say that perhaps he is still living.\" \"What do you know, then?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Simply this, that if Captain Grant is living he is in Australia.\" \"Where did the shipwreck take place?\" inquired the major. This should have been the first question; but, in the excitement of the moment, Glenarvan, anxious to know where Captain Grant was, had not inquired where the Britannia was lost. From this point the conversation assumed a more definite form, and soon the details of the complicated story appeared clear and exact to the minds of Ayrton's hearers. To the major's question Ayrton replied,-- \"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not two cable-lengths distant. The shipwreck, therefore, took place at that point.\" \"In latitude",

Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: \"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\" \"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan. \"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives.\" \"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?\" \"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\" \"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the interior of so vast a continent?\" A prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently cast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a responsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom. His usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with long strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in some difficulty. \"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the quartermaster, \"what would you do?\" \"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan, and go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act according to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\" \"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is repaired.\" \"Ah! you have suffered injuries?\" inquired Ayrton. \"Yes,\" replies the captain. \"Serious?\" \"No; but they necessitate repairs which cannot be made on board. One of the flanges of the screw is bent, and this work can be done only at Melbourne.\" \"Can you not sail?\" asked the quartermaster. \"Yes; but, if the wind is contrary, it would take considerable time to reach Twofold Bay, and at any rate we should have to return to Melbourne.\" \"Well, let the yacht go to Melbourne,\" said Paganel, \"and we will go without her to Twofold Bay.\" \"But how?\" \"By crossing Australia, as we crossed South America.\" \"But the Duncan?\" added Ayrton, with singular persistency. \"The Duncan will join us, or we will join her, according to circumstances. If Captain Grant is found during our journey, we will return together to Melbourne. If, on the contrary, we continue our search to the coast, the Duncan shall join us there. Who has any objections to make to this plan? Have you, major?\" \"No,\" replied MacNabb, \"if it is practicable.\" \"So practicable,\" said Paganel, \"that I propose that Lady Helena and Miss Grant accompany us.\" \"Do you speak seriously, Paganel?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Quite seriously, my lord. It is a journey of three hundred and fifty miles. At the rate of twelve miles a day it would last scarcely a month,--long enough to give time for repairing the Duncan.\" \"But the ferocious animals?\" said Glenarvan, wishing to state all possible objections. [Sidenote: OBSTACLES EXPLAINED AWAY.] \"There are none in Australia.\" \"But the savages?\" \"There are none in the course we shall take.\" \"Well, then, the convicts?\" \"There are no convicts in the southern provinces of Australia, but only in the eastern colonies.\" \"Mr. Paganel is perfectly right,\" said O'Moore; \"they have all left the southern provinces. Since I have lived on this farm, I have not heard of one.\" \"And, for my part, I never met one,\" added Ayrton. \"You see, my friends,\" continued Paganel, \"that there are few savages, no wild beasts, and no convicts. There are not many countries of Europe of which we could say as much. Well, is it agreed?\" \"What do you think, Helena?\" asked Glenarvan. \"What we all think,\" replied she, turning towards her companions. \"Forward!\" CHAPTER XXXII. PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY. It was not Glenarvan's habit to lose time in adopting and executing a plan. As soon as Paganel's proposal was accepted, he at once resolved that the preparations for the journey should be completed as soon as possible. And what was to be the result of this search? The existence of Harry Grant seemed to have become undeniable, which increased the probabilities of success. No one expected to find the captain exactly on the line of the thirty-seventh parallel; but perhaps they would come upon traces of him, and, at all events, their course would bring them straight to the scene of the shipwreck, which was the principal point. Moreover, if Ayrton would consent to join the travelers, to guide them through the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance of success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was therefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain Grant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for him to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented, though not without regret at losing so good an assistant. \"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the Britannia?\" The quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for a few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said: \"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the track of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where his vessel was wrecked.\" \"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan. \"One question, my lord.\" \"Ask it.\" \"Where will you",

Ayrton and O'Moore's family returned to their home. The horses and cart were to be ready the next day, and the travelers were to start at eight o'clock in the morning. Lady Helena and Mary Grant now made their last preparations, which were short and less minute than those of Jacques Paganel. The geographer passed half the night in unscrewing, cleaning, and screwing on again the lenses of his telescope. He was still asleep the next morning, when the major awoke him early with a loud summons. The baggage had already been conveyed to the farm through the care of Captain Mangles. A boat was waiting for the travelers, and they were not long in embarking. The young captain gave his last orders to Tom Austin, and instructed him above all to await the commands of Lord Glenarvan at Melbourne, and execute them scrupulously whatever they might be. The trusty sailor replied that they might rely on him. In the name of the crew he offered to his lordship their best wishes for the success of the expedition. The boat put off, and a thunder of applause rent the air. In a few moments the party reached the shore, and in no great length of time arrived at O'Moore's farm. Everything was ready. Lady Helena was delighted with her quarters. The immense cart, with its rude wheels and massive timbers, especially pleased her. The six oxen yoked in pairs seemed to indicate primeval simplicity, and were a novel sight. Ayrton, whip in hand, awaited the orders of his new chief. [Illustration: Ayrton and Olbinett took their places respectively in front and in the rear part of the cart, while Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, Robert, Captain Mangles, and the two sailors, mounted their horses.] \"I declare!\" said Paganel, \"this is an admirable vehicle, worth all the mail-coaches in the world. I know of no better way of traversing the earth than in this style, like mountebanks. A house that moves when you please and stops wherever you please is all you can desire.\" [Illustration: The \"Mosquito Plains,\" whose very name describes them, and serves to tell of the tortures that our friends had to encounter.] \"Monsieur Paganel,\" replied Lady Helena, \"I hope to have the pleasure of receiving you in my parlor.\" \"Madam,\" replied the geographer, \"you do me great honor! Have you chosen a day?\" \"I shall be at home every day for my friends,\" replied Lady Helena, smiling, \"and you are----\" \"The most devoted of all,\" added Paganel, gallantly. This exchange of compliments was interrupted by the arrival of seven horses, all harnessed, driven by one of O'Moore's sons. Lord Glenarvan paid for these new acquisitions, and added many thanks, which the honest colonist seemed to value as highly as the gold and notes which he received. The signal for departure was now given. Lady Helena and Miss Grant seated themselves in their compartment, Ayrton and Olbinett took their places respectively in front and in the rear part of the cart, while Glenarvan, the major, Paganel, Robert, Captain Mangles, and the two sailors, all armed with carbines and revolvers, mounted their horses. A \"God bless you\" was Mr. O'Moore's parting salute, which was echoed in chorus by his family. Ayrton uttered a peculiar cry, and started his long team. The cart moved, the timbers cracked, the axles creaked, and the farm of the honest hospitable Irishman soon disappeared from view at the turn of the road. CHAPTER XXXIII. AN ACCIDENT. Our travelers made tolerably good progress by their new mode of conveyance. The heat was great, but endurable, and the road was quite easy for the horses. They were still in the province of South Australia, and in this part at least the scenery was not of the most interesting character. A succession of small hills, with very dusty tracks, small shrubs, and scant herbage, had to be traversed for several miles; and when these had been passed they reached the \"Mosquito Plains,\" whose very name describes them, and serves to tell of the tortures that our friends had to encounter. Both the bipeds and the quadrupeds suffered terribly from the infliction of these flying pests, whom to avoid was impossible; but there was some consolation for the former in the spirits of hartshorn, carried in the medicine-chest, which alleviated the pain caused by the sting of those whom Paganel was continually consigning to a place and person whom they would not visit. But shortly a more pleasant neighborhood was reached. Hedges of acacias, then a newly cut and better made roadway, then European imported trees--oaks, olives, and lemons,--then a well-kept fence,--all these signs told of their approach to Red-gum Station, the home and settlement of an emigrant engaged in the cattle-breeding which is the source of so much Australian wealth. It was in itself an establishment of small importance; but to its owners it was a home, and to its visitors, on this occasion, it was a hotel, as the \"station\" generally is to the traveler. [Illustration: Red-gum Station, the home and settlement of an emigrant engaged in the cattle-breeding which is the source of so much Australian wealth.] [Illustration: The major was skillful enough to shoot a very rare bird,--a \"jabiru,\" or giant crane. This creature was five feet high; and its broad, black, sharp conical beak measured eighteen inches in length.] Glenarvan's party invariably found beneath the roof of these solitary settlers a well-spread and hospitable table; and in the Australian farmer they always met an obliging host. After a night spent at this resting-place the party advanced through a grove, and at evening encamped on the shores of a brackish and muddy lake. Mr. Olbinett prepared supper with his usual promptness, and the travelers--some in the cart and others under the tent--were not long in falling asleep, in spite of the dismal howlings of the dingos,--the jackals of Australia. The next morning Glenarvan and his companions were greeted with a magnificent sight. As far as the eye could reach, the landscape seemed to be one flowery meadow in spring-like luxuriance.

I repeat that I thought he was buried in the waves or dashed upon the rocks. You say that perhaps he is still living.\" \"What do you know, then?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Simply this, that if Captain Grant is living he is in Australia.\" \"Where did the shipwreck take place?\" inquired the major. This should have been the first question; but, in the excitement of the moment, Glenarvan, anxious to know where Captain Grant was, had not inquired where the Britannia was lost. From this point the conversation assumed a more definite form, and soon the details of the complicated story appeared clear and exact to the minds of Ayrton's hearers. To the major's question Ayrton replied,-- \"When I was washed from the forecastle, as I was hauling down the jib, the Britannia was driving towards the coast of Australia, which was not two cable-lengths distant. The shipwreck, therefore, took place at that point.\" \"In latitude thirty-seven?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"Thirty-seven,\" replied Ayrton. \"On the west coast?\" \"No. On the east coast.\" \"And when?\" \"On the night of June 27th, 1862.\" \"The same! the very same!\" cried Glenarvan. \"You see, then, my lord,\" added Ayrton, \"that I was right in saying that, if Captain Grant still lives, you must seek him in Australia.\" [Sidenote: OLD MEMORIES.] \"And we will seek, find, and save him, my friend!\" cried Paganel. \"Ah, precious document!\" added he, with perfect simplicity: \"it must be confessed that you have fallen into the hands of very sagacious people.\" No one noticed these flattering words of Paganel. Glenarvan, Lady Helena, Mary, and Robert had crowded around Ayrton, and eagerly clasped his hands. It seemed as if the presence of this man was a guarantee of the safety of Harry Grant. Since the sailor had escaped the dangers of shipwreck, why should not the captain be safe and sound? Ayrton repeated his declaration that if Captain Grant were living he must be in Australia. He answered with remarkable intelligence and clearness the many questions that were propounded to him. Miss Mary, while he spoke, held one of his hands in her own. This sailor had been a companion of her father, one of the shipwrecked survivors of the Britannia. He had lived with Harry Grant, had sailed the seas with him, had braved the same dangers! She could not withdraw her eyes from that weather-beaten face, and she wept with happiness. Hitherto no one had thought of doubting the veracity of the quartermaster. Only the major, and perhaps Captain Mangles, questioned whether Ayrton's story merited _entire_ confidence. This unexpected meeting might be suspicious. To be sure, Ayrton had mentioned facts and dates that agreed, and striking particulars. But details, however exact they may be, do not constitute a certainty; and generally, as we know, falsehood endeavors to strengthen itself by its preciseness. MacNabb, therefore, reserved his opinion. [Illustration: When he came to himself, he was in the hands of the natives, who carried him into the interior of the country.] As for Captain Mangles, his doubts did not stand long before the assertions of the sailor, and he considered him a real companion of Captain Grant when he heard him speak to the young girl of her father. Ayrton knew Mary and Robert perfectly. He had seen them at Glasgow on the departure of the Britannia. He remembered that they had been present at the farewell dinner given on board to the friends of the captain. Sheriff MacIntyre was one of the guests. Robert--scarcely ten years old--had been confided to the care of Dick Turner, the boatswain, but had escaped from him and climbed to the top-sail yard-arm. [Illustration: At last, exhausted and almost dead, he reached the hospitable dwelling of Mr. O'Moore, where his labor insured him a comfortable livelihood.] \"It is true! it is true!\" cried Robert. The quartermaster remembered, too, a thousand little circumstances to which he did not seem to attach so much importance as did Captain Mangles. When he stopped, Mary said, in her sweet voice,-- \"Mr. Ayrton, please tell us more about our father.\" Ayrton acceded to the young girl's request. Glenarvan was reluctant to interrupt him, and yet many more important questions thronged his mind. But Lady Helena, pointing out to him Mary's joyful excitement, checked his inquiries. [Sidenote: TWO YEARS OF SLAVERY.] The quartermaster now told the story of the Britannia and her voyage across the Pacific. During the period of a year Harry Grant landed at the principal ports of Oceanica, opposing unjustifiable captures, and often a victim to the hostility of unjust traders. He found, however, an important point on the western coast of Papua. Here the establishment of a Scottish colony appeared to him feasible, and its prosperity assured. After examining Papua, the Britannia sailed to Callao for provisions, and left that port on the 30th of May, 1862, to return to Europe by the way of the Indian Ocean and the Cape. Three weeks after her departure, a terrible tempest disabled her. It became necessary to cut away the masts. A leak was discovered in the hold, which they did not succeed in stopping. The crew were soon overtasked and exhausted. The pumps could not be worked. For eight days the vessel was at the mercy of the storm. There were six feet of water in her hold, and she gradually foundered. The boats had been washed overboard, and the crew had given themselves up for lost, when on the night of June 22nd, as Paganel had rightly interpreted, they descried the eastern coast of Australia. The vessel soon stranded. A violent shock was felt. At this moment Ayrton, borne by a wave, was cast into the midst of the breakers, and lost all consciousness. When he came to himself, he was in the hands of",

      "text": " Irishman's farm, and was received as a servant under my true name of Ayrton. Here I waited till an opportunity should be offered to gain possession of a vessel. This was my great object. Two months later the Duncan arrived. During your visit at the farm you related, my lord, the whole story of Captain Grant. I then learned what I had not known, the Britannia's stoppage at Callao, the last news of her, dated June, 1862, two months after my abandonment, the finding of the document, the shipwreck of the vessel, and finally the important reasons you had for seeking Captain Grant in Australia. I did not hesitate, but resolved to appropriate the Duncan,--a marvelous ship, that would have distanced the best of the British navy. However, there were serious injuries to be repaired. I therefore let her start for Melbourne, and offered myself to you in my real character of quartermaster, volunteering to guide you to the scene of the shipwreck, which I falsely located on the eastern coast of Australia. Thus followed at a distance and sometimes preceded by my band of convicts, I conducted your party across the province of Victoria. My companions committed a useless crime at Camden Bridge, since the Duncan, once at Twofold Bay, could not have escaped me, and with it I should have been master of the ocean. I brought you thus unsuspectingly as far as the Snowy River. The horses and oxen fell dead one by one, poisoned by the gastrolobium. I entangled the cart in the marshes. At my suggestion----but you know the rest, my lord, and can be certain that, except for Mr. Paganel's absent-mindedness, I should now be commander on board the Duncan. Such is my story, gentlemen. My disclosures, unfortunately, cannot set you on the track of Captain Grant, and you see that in dealing with me you have made a bad bargain.\" The quartermaster ceased, crossed his arms, according to his custom, and waited. Glenarvan and his friends were silent. They felt that this strange criminal had told the entire truth. The capture of the Duncan had only failed through a cause altogether beyond his control. His accomplices had reached Twofold Bay, as the convict's blouse, found by Glenarvan, proved. There, faithful to the orders of their chief, they had lain in wait for the yacht, and at last, tired of watching, they had doubtless resumed their occupation of plunder and burning in the fields of New South Wales. The major was the first to resume the examination, in order to determine the dates relative to the Britannia. \"It was the 8th of April, 1862, then, that you were landed on the west coast of Australia?\" he asked of the quartermaster. \"Exactly,\" replied Ayrton. \"And do you know what Captain Grant's plans were then?\" \"Vaguely.\" \"Continue, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan. \"The least sign may set us on the track.\" \"What I can say is this, my lord. Captain Grant intended to visit New Zealand. But this part of his programme was not carried out while I was on board. The Britannia might, therefore, after leaving Callao, have gained the shores of New Zealand. This would agree with the date, June 27, 1862, given in the document as the time of the shipwreck.\" \"Evidently,\" remarked Paganel. \"But,\" added Glenarvan, \"there is nothing in these half-obliterated portions of the document which can apply to New Zealand.\" \"That I cannot answer,\" said the quartermaster. \"Well, Ayrton,\" continued Glenarvan, \"you have kept your word, and I will keep mine. We will decide on what island of the Pacific you shall be abandoned.\" \"Oh, it matters little to me,\" answered Ayrton. \"Return to your cabin now, and await our decision.\" The quartermaster retired, under guard of the two sailors. \"This villain might have been a great man,\" observed the major. \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan. \"He has a strong and self-reliant character. Why must his abilities be devoted to crime?\" \"But Harry Grant?\" \"I fear that he is forever lost! Poor children! who could tell them where their father is?\" \"I!\" cried Paganel. As we have remarked, the geographer, although so loquacious and excitable usually, had scarcely spoken during Ayrton's examination. He had listened in total silence. But this last word that he had uttered was worth more than all the others, and startled Glenarvan at once. \"You, Paganel!\" he exclaimed; \"do you know where Captain Grant is?\" \"As well as can be known,\" answered the geographer. \"And how do you know?\" \"By that everlasting document.\" [Sidenote: A GEOGRAPHER'S REMINISCENCES.] \"Ah!\" said the major, in a tone of the most thorough incredulity. \"Listen first, MacNabb, and shrug your shoulders afterwards. I did not speak before, because you would not have believed me. Besides, it was useless. But if I speak to-day, it is because Ayrton's opinion corroborates mine.\" \"Then New Zealand----?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Hear and judge,\" replied Paganel. \"I did not commit the blunder that saved us, without reason. Just as I was writing that letter at Glenarvan's dictation, the word Zealand was troubling my brain. You remember that we were in the cart. MacNabb had just told Lady Helena the story of the convicts, and had handed her the copy of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ that gave an account of the accident at Camden Bridge. As I was writing, the paper lay on the ground, folded so that only two syllables of its title could be seen, and these were _aland_. What a light broke in upon my mind! 'Aland' was one of the very words in the English document,--a word that we had hitherto translated _ashore_, but which was the termination of the proper name Zealand.\" \"Ha!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Yes,\" continued Paganel, with profound conviction, \"this interpretation had escaped me, and do you know why? Because my examinations were naturally confined more particularly to the French document, where this important word was wanting.\" \"Ho! ho!\" laughed the major, \"that is too much imagination, Paganel. You forget your previous conclusions rather easily.\" \"Well, major, I am ready to answer you.\" \"Then what becomes of your",

      "text": " young gentlemen were soon made acquainted with the object of the expedition, and took a lively interest in Glenarvan's search, giving also great encouragement to the captain's children. \"Harry Grant,\" said Michael, \"has evidently fallen into the hands of the natives, since he has not appeared in the settlements on the coast. He knew his position exactly, as the document proves, and, as he has not reached any English colony, he must have been made prisoner by the natives as soon as he landed.\" \"That is precisely what happened to his quartermaster, Ayrton,\" replied Captain Mangles. \"But, gentlemen,\" inquired Lady Helena, \"have you never heard of the shipwreck of the Britannia?\" \"Never, madam,\" said Michael. \"And what treatment do you think Captain Grant would experience as a prisoner among the Australians?\" \"The Australians are not cruel, madam,\" replied the young settler: \"Miss Grant may reassure herself on this point. There are many instances of their kindness; and some Europeans have lived a long time among them, without having any reason to complain of brutality.\" These words corroborated the information previously given by Paganel and Ayrton. When the ladies had left the table, the conversation turned upon convicts. The settlers had heard of the accident at Camden Bridge, but the band of runaways gave no uneasiness, they would not dare to attack a station that was guarded by more than a hundred men. They were confident, too, that they would not venture into the deserted regions of the Murray, nor into the colonies of New South Wales, where the roads are well protected. [Sidenote: A DAY'S SPORT.] Glenarvan could not decline the invitation of his amiable hosts to spend the entire day at Hottam Station. The delay thus occasioned could be turned to good account: the horses and oxen would be greatly benefited by their rest in the comfortable stables of the establishment. It was, therefore, decided to remain, and the two young men submitted to their guests a programme for the day's sports, which was adopted with alacrity. [Illustration: It was a charming house of wood and brick, surrounded by clusters of plants, and had the elegant form of a Swiss cottage.] At noon, seven fine hunters pawed the ground at the gate of the house. For the ladies was provided an elegant coach, and the long reins enabled their driver to show his skill in manoeuvring the \"four-in-hand.\" The horsemen, accompanied by outriders, and well armed, galloped beside the carriage, while the pack of hounds bayed joyously in the coppices. For four hours the cavalcade traversed the paths and avenues of these spacious grounds. As for game, an army of bushmen could not have started up a greater number of animals. Young Robert, who kept close to the major's side, accomplished wonders. The intrepid boy, in spite of his sister's injunctions, was always ahead, and the first to fire. But Captain Mangles had promised to watch over him, a fact which tended not a little to allay Miss Grant's apprehension for her brother's safety. Of all the sports of the day the most interesting was unquestionably a kangaroo hunt. About four o'clock the dogs started a troop of these curious animals. The little ones took refuge in their mothers' pouches, and the whole drove rushed away in single file. Nothing can be more astonishing than the enormous bounds of the kangaroo, whose hind legs are twice as long as its fore ones, and bend like a spring. At the head of the drove was a male five feet high,--\"an old man,\" in the language of the bushmen. For four or five miles the chase was briskly continued. The kangaroos did not slacken their pace; and the dogs, who feared, with good reason, the powerful blows of their formidable paws, did not venture to approach them. But at last the drove stopped in exhaustion, and \"the old man\" braced himself against the trunk of a tree, ready to fight for his life. One of the pointers, carried on by the impetus of his course, rolled within reach of him. A moment after, the unfortunate dog was tossed into the air, and fell back lifeless. The entire pack, deterred by the fate of their comrade, kept at a respectful distance. It became necessary to dispatch the kangaroo with the rifle, and nothing but bullets could bring down the gigantic quadruped. At this juncture Robert narrowly escaped being the victim of his rashness. In order to make sure of his aim, he approached so near the kangaroo that the animal made a spring at him. Robert fell. A cry of alarm resounded. Mary Grant, speechless with apprehension, stretched her hands towards her brother. No one dared to fire, for fear of hitting the boy. Suddenly Captain Mangles, with his hunting-knife open, rushed upon the kangaroo, at the risk of his life, and stabbed it to the heart. The beast fell dead, and Robert rose unharmed. An instant after, he was in the arms of his sister. \"Thanks, Captain Mangles! thanks!\" said Mary, extending her hand to the young captain. \"I promised to take care of him,\" replied the captain, as he took the trembling hand of the young girl. This adventure ended the hunt. The troop of kangaroos had scattered after the death of their leader, whose carcass was brought to the house. It was now six o'clock, and dinner was in readiness for the hunters; comprising, among other dishes, a soup of kangaroo's tail, prepared in the native style. After a dessert of ices and sherbet, the party repaired to the parlor, where the evening was devoted to music. Lady Helena, who was a good pianiste, presided at the instrument, while Michael and Alexander Patterson sang with great taste selections from the latest compositions of the modern musical masters. [Sidenote: A FRESH DEPARTURE.] At eleven o'clock tea was served in true English style. Paganel having desired to taste the Australian tea, a liquid, black as ink, was brought to him. It consisted of a quart of water, in which half a pound of tea had been boiled four hours. Paganel, with a wry face, pronounced it excellent. At midnight the guests were conducted to cool and comfortable chambers, where they renewed in dreams the pleasures of the day. The next morning, at sunrise, they took leave of the two young settlers, with many thanks, and with warmly-expressed hopes to see them at Malcolm Castle at no very distant day. The cart then started, and in a few minutes,",

      "text": " \"you are weeping!\" \"What is the matter, my child?\" asked Lady Helena. \"My father, madam, my father!\" replied the young girl. She could not continue. But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of each. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her eyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips. The discovery of Ayrton's treachery destroyed all hope. The convict, to entice Glenarvan on, had invented a shipwreck. In their conversation, overheard by MacNabb, his accomplices had clearly confessed it. The Britannia had never been wrecked on the reefs of Twofold Bay! Harry Grant had never set foot on the Australian continent! For the second time an erroneous interpretation of the document had set the searchers of the Britannia on a false trail. All, in the face of this situation and the grief of the two children, preserved a mournful silence. Who then could have found words of hope? Robert wept in his sister's arms. Paganel murmured, in a voice of despair,-- [Sidenote: CALM AND CLOUDINESS.] \"Ah, unlucky document! You can boast of having sorely puzzled the brains of a dozen brave people!\" And the worthy geographer was fairly furious against himself, and frantically beat his forehead. In the mean time Glenarvan had joined Mulready and Wilson, who were on guard without. A deep silence reigned on the plain lying between the wood and the river. Heavy clouds covered the vault of the sky. In this deadened and torpid atmosphere the least sound would have been clearly transmitted; but nothing was heard. Ben Joyce and his band must have fled to a considerable distance; for flocks of birds that sported on the low branches of the trees, several kangaroos peacefully browsing on the young shoots, and a pair of cassowaries, whose unsuspecting heads were thrust between the tall bushes, proved that the presence of man did not disturb these peaceful solitudes. \"You have not seen nor heard anything for an hour?\" inquired Glenarvan of the two sailors. \"Nothing, my lord,\" replied Wilson. \"The convicts must be several miles away.\" \"They cannot have been in sufficient force to attack us,\" added Mulready. \"This Ben Joyce probably intended to recruit some bandits, like himself, among the bushrangers that wander at the foot of the Alps.\" \"Very likely, Mulready,\" replied Glenarvan. \"These rascals are cowards. They know we are well armed, and are perhaps waiting for darkness to commence their attack. We must redouble our vigilance at nightfall. If we could only leave this marshy plain and pursue our journey towards the coast! But the swollen waters of the river bar our progress. I would pay its weight in gold for a raft that would transport us to the other side!\" \"Why,\" said Wilson, \"does not your lordship give us the order to construct this raft? There is plenty of wood.\" \"No, Wilson,\" answered Glenarvan; \"this Snowy is not a river, it is an impassable torrent.\" [Illustration: A pair of cassowaries proved that the presence of man did not disturb these peaceful solitudes.] [Sidenote: READINESS FOR SERVICE.] At this moment Captain Mangles, the major, and Paganel joined Glenarvan. They had been to examine the Snowy. The waters, swollen by the recent rains, had risen a foot above low-water mark, and formed an impetuous current. It was impossible to venture upon this roaring deluge, these rushing floods, broken into a thousand eddies by the depressions of the river-bed. Captain Mangles declared that the passage was impracticable. \"But,\" added he, \"we ought not to remain here without making any attempt. What we wished to do before Ayrton's treason is still more necessary now.\" \"What do you say, captain?\" asked Glenarvan. \"I say that assistance is needed; and since we cannot go to Twofold Bay, we must go to Melbourne. One horse is left. Let your lordship give him to me, and I will go.\" \"But it is a perilous venture, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"Aside from the dangers of this journey of two hundred miles across an unknown country, all the roads may be guarded by Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" \"I know it, my lord; but I know, too, that our situation cannot be prolonged. Ayrton only asked eight days' absence to bring back the crew of the Duncan. But I will return in six days to the banks of the Snowy. What are your lordship's orders?\" \"Before Glenarvan speaks,\" said Paganel, \"I must make a remark. It is well that one of us should go to Melbourne, but not that these dangers should be incurred by Captain Mangles. He is the captain of the Duncan, and must not, therefore, expose himself. Allow me to go in his place.\" \"Well said,\" replied the major; \"but why should it be you, Paganel?\" \"Are we not here?\" cried Wilson and Mulready. \"And do you believe,\" continued MacNabb, \"that I am afraid to make a journey of two hundred miles on horseback?\" \"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"if one of us is to go to Melbourne, let fate decide. Paganel, write our names----\" \"Not yours at least, my lord,\" insisted Captain Mangles. \"And why?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Separate you from Lady Helena, when your wound is not yet healed?\" \"Glenarvan,\" interposed Paganel, \"you cannot leave the encampment.\" \"No,\" resumed the major; \"your place is here. Edward, you must not go.\" \"There are dangers to incur,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and I will not leave my part to others. Write, Paganel; let my name be mingled with those of my companions, and Heaven grant that it may be the first drawn.\" All yielded to this wish; and Glenarvan's name was added to the others. They then proceeded to draw, and the lot fell upon Mulready. The brave sailor uttered a cry of joy. \"My lord, I am ready to go,\" said he. Glenarvan clasped his hand, and then turned towards the cart, leaving the major and Captain Mangles to guard the encampment. Lady Helena was at once informed of the decision taken to send a messenger to Melbourne, and of the result of the drawing by lot. She spoke words to Mulready that went to the heart",
