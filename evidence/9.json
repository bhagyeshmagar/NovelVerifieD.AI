This unfortunate word led Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally shown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each other with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised \"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire voyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in the study of Spanish. \"After all,\" he added, in conclusion, \"misfortunes are sometimes beneficial, and I do not regret my error.\" \"And why, my worthy friend?\" asked the major. \"Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also. I speak two languages instead of one.\" \"By my faith, I should not have thought of that,\" replied MacNabb. \"My compliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!\" [Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.] Paganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not, however, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the young captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign from Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at the two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed the captain, but upon a different subject. \"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired. \"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship that we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\" \"Hang yourself!\" said the major. \"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my rope!\" retorted the geographer. \"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with ubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you could not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated by Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,-- \"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your noble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased with his ship.\" \"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps also at the young captain. \"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\" \"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a little confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to the face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the captain added,-- \"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give us a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young hero?\" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word for word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage of the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by the condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves, the boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation, their refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators, the water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these incidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror of his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert the caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly praised, or by more enthusiastic friends. \"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his recital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of Captain Grant.\" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's state-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and charts, resumed the conversation. Glenarvan explained that the shipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or the Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly interpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a sudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had been following a false trail. The geographer was accordingly asked to explain the French document, which he did to the satisfaction of every one. When he had finished his demonstration, Glenarvan announced that the Duncan would immediately set sail for Australia. The major, however, before the order was given, asked permission to make a single remark. \"Speak, major,\" said Glenarvan. \"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them. I consider them rational, sagacious, and worthy of our whole attention. But I desire to submit them to a final examination, that their validity may be incontestable.\" [Illustration: \"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them.\"] No one knew what the prudent MacNabb meant, and his hearers listened with some anxiety. \"Go on, major,\" said Paganel: \"I am ready to answer all your questions.\" \"Nothing can be simpler,\" said the major. \"Five months ago, in the Frith of Clyde, when we studied the three documents, their interpretation seemed clear to us. No place but the western coast of Patagonia could, we thought, have been the scene of the shipwreck. We had not even the shadow of a doubt on the subject.\" \"Very true,\" added Glenarvan. \"Afterwards,\" resumed the major, \"when Paganel, in a moment of providential absent-mindedness, embarked on board our vessel, the documents were submitted to him, and he unhesitatingly sanctioned our search upon the American coast.\" \"You are right,\" observed the geographer. \"And, nevertheless, we are mistaken,\" said the major. \"Yes, we are mistaken,\" repeated Paganel; \"but to be mistaken is only to be human, while it is the part of a madman to persist in his error.\" \"Wait, Paganel,\" continued the major; \"do not get excited. I do not mean that our search ought to",

      "text": ", and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in search of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their captain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence proceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at heart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly interested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well, that, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had perceived it. As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the southern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which he covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with Mr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major, who was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at dinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's chests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman resolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would facilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for philology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on arriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard incessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours he did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught him the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She cut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait of the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia were seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They sailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous telescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered without hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels bound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and seventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep water, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of water. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe and easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources that are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks of Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests. [Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves.] During the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory, the shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely thirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well rewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant beams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the continent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of Terra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between two magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous masses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart of immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow, were lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered six thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long twilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while the sky was studded with brilliant stars. In the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on her course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the shores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would beat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe, teal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins appeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect; these were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name will be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and the rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the Spaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here he founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold weakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared, and in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred unfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in existence. [Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.] The vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed in the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and birches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas tapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the obelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported droves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting, which could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled Cape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other side of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the height of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands of clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky. [Illustration: Port Famine.] Cape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn is only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed between Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile shores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets of this tortuous labyrinth. The Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious windings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks. Without lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories established on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened. The yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern shores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks of Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation Island. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and Jacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved like Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled before the breezes of the Pacific.

The major accordingly undertook the part of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even told Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough, could not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too charming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she were less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect woman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel confessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would facilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his track! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy friend?\" \"Is that your opinion?\" \"On the contrary, you are only more remarkable. This adds to your personal advantages. It makes you the inimitable individual of whom Arabella has dreamed.\" And the major, preserving an imperturbable gravity, left Paganel a prey to the most acute anxiety. A short interview took place between MacNabb and the lady, and fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle. [Illustration: Fifteen weeks after a marriage was celebrated with great pomp in the chapel of Malcolm Castle.] The geographer's secret would doubtless have remained forever buried in the abysses of the unknown if the major had not told it to Glenarvan, who did not conceal it from Lady Helena, who communicated it to Mrs. Mangles. In short, it reached the ear of Mrs. Olbinett, and spread. Jacques Paganel, during his three days' captivity among the Maoris, had been tattooed from head to foot, and bore on his breast the picture of an heraldic kiwi with outstretched wings, in the act of biting at his heart. This was the only adventure of his great voyage for which Paganel could never be consoled or pardon the New Zealanders. In spite of the representations of his friends, he dared not go back to France, for fear of exposing the whole Geographical Society in his person to the jests and railleries of the caricaturists. The return of Captain Grant to Scotland was welcomed as a cause for national rejoicing, and he became the popular man of old Caledonia. His son Robert has become a sailor like himself, and, under the patronage of Lord Glenarvan, has undertaken the plan of founding a Scottish colony on the shores washed by the Pacific Ocean. *** END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK 46597 ***",

      "text": " He held in his hand the letter written by Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan. \"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor. Glenarvan took the letter, and read: \"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the eastern coast of New Zealand.\" \"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting. He snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes, adjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn. \"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter slipped from his fingers. Just then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found himself face to face with the major. [Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.] \"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is fortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\" This sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the whole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his hands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his frenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer. \"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your absent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the Duncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we should have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange association of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write New Zealand instead of Australia?\" \"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\" But at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he stopped short, finally replying: \"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible being, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\" The affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's presence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved, thought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a good breakfast. However, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and Robert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom Austin with them. They wished to question him further. \"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail for the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\" \"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I am not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could I act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your instructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done differently, captain?\" \"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles. \"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan. \"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was necessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of circumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that I was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover, on leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did not know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had disappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me very much.\" \"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned, the day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\" \"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles. \"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain. In an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his long-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready, their sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds, flashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality, the convict was in their power. \"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly. \"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\" \"Why this confinement?\" [Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.] \"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand, he flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the ship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged my men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was compelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come out.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the saloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took seats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on deck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate would be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain, if you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his intended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their places beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain Mangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered so severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did not yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a profound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his teeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing displayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord Glenarvan's presence, he folded his arms,",
