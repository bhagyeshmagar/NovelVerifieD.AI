The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a flight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances might indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a transaction; but still it was better to await the result. What, moreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed savages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe had lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to recover; and he was not mistaken. The next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness. It stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound across the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten natives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged salutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had recently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their tattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled beneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the indifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the captives. Towards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains, whose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-bank. Here twenty natives, who had disembarked from their canoes, were making preparations for the night. Fires blazed beneath the trees. A chief, equal in rank to Kai-Koumou, advanced with measured pace, and, rubbing his nose against that of the latter, saluted him cordially. The prisoners were stationed in the centre of the encampment, and guarded with extreme vigilance. The next morning the ascent of the Waikato was resumed. Other boats came from various affluents of the river. Sixty warriors, evidently fugitives from the last insurrection, had now assembled, and were returning, more or less wounded in the fray, to the mountain districts. Sometimes a song arose from the canoes, as they advanced in single file. One native struck up the patriotic ode of the mysterious \"Pihé,\" the national hymn that calls the Maoris to battle. The full and sonorous voice of the singer waked the echoes of the mountains; and after each stanza his comrades struck their breasts, and sang the warlike verses in chorus. Then they seized their oars again, and the canoes were headed up stream. During the day a singular sight enlivened the voyage. About four o'clock the canoe, without lessening its speed, guided by the steady hand of the chief, dashed through a narrow gorge. Eddies broke violently against numerous small islands, which rendered navigation exceeding dangerous. Never could it be more hazardous to capsize, for the banks afforded no refuge, and whoever had set foot on the porous crust of the shore would probably have perished. At this point the river flowed between warm springs, oxide of iron colored the muddy ground a brilliant red, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen. The air was heavy with a penetrating sulphureous odor. The natives did not regard it, but the captives were seriously annoyed by the noxious vapors exhaled from the fissures of the soil and the bubbles that burst and discharged their gaseous contents. Yet, however disagreeable these emanations were, the eye could not but admire this magnificent spectacle. [Illustration: At this point the river flowed between warm springs, and not a yard of firm earth could be seen.] The canoes soon after entered a dense cloud of white smoke, whose wreaths rose in gradually decreasing circles above the river. On the shores a hundred geysers, some shooting forth masses of vapor, and others overflowing in liquid columns, varied their effects, like the jets and cascades of a fountain. It seemed as though some engineer was directing at his pleasure the outflowings of these springs, as the waters and vapor, mingling in the air, formed rainbows in the sunbeams. For two miles the canoes glided within this vapory atmosphere, enveloped in its warm waves that rolled along the surface of the water. Then the sulphureous smoke disappeared, and a pure swift current of fresh air refreshed the panting voyagers. The region of the springs was passed. Before the close of the day two more rapids were ascended, and at evening Kai-Koumou encamped a hundred miles above the junction of the two streams. The river now turned towards the east, and then again flowed southward into Lake Taupo. The next morning Jacques Paganel consulted his map and discovered on the right bank Mount Taubara, which rises to the height of three thousand feet. At noon the whole fleet of boats entered Lake Taupo, and the natives hailed with frantic gestures a shred of cloth that waved in the wind from the roof of a hut. It was the national flag. CHAPTER XLIX. A MOMENTOUS INTERVIEW. [Sidenote: NEW ZEALAND TOPOGRAPHY.] Long before historic times, an abyss, twenty-five miles long and twenty wide, must at some period have been formed by a subsidence of subterranean caverns in the volcanic district forming the centre of the island. The waters of the surrounding country have rushed down and filled this enormous cavity, and the abyss has become a lake, whose depth no one has yet been able to measure. Such is this strange Lake Taupo, elevated eleven hundred and fifty feet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by lofty mountains. On the west of the prisoners towered precipitous rocks of imposing form; on the north rose several distant ridges, crowned with small forests; on the east spread a broad plain furrowed by a trail and covered with pumice-stones that glittered beneath a net-work of bushes; and on the north, behind a stretch of woodland, volcanic peaks majestically encircled this vast extent of water, the fury of whose tempests equaled that of the ocean cyclones. But Paganel was scarcely disposed to enlarge his account of these wonders, nor were his friends in a mood to listen. They gazed in silence towards the northeast shore of the lake, whither the canoe was bringing them. The mission established at Pukawa, on the western shores, no longer existed. The missionary had been driven by the war far from the principal dwellings of the insurrectionists. The prisoners were helpless, abandoned to the mercy of the vengeful Maoris, and in that wild part of the island to which Christianity has never penetrated. Kai-Koumou",

      "text": " Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages.\" \"They have done wrong,\" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. \"I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power.\" \"Listen,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken.\" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: \"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound wonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. \"Then you doubt it?\" said he. \"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\" \"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\" \"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\" \"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered Glenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would have rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. \"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards them, \"hold a high rank in their country.\" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed over his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a voice which he could scarcely control: \"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed European? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said: \"That is your wife!\" \"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady Helena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. \"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was filled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with one hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other the throng that was rushing upon the Europeans. [Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.] At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he. At this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions, thus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after they were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but Robert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them. CHAPTER L. THE CHIEF'S FUNERAL. Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined the rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to persons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power to prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious hand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the offended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own insult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued them from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and partisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their chief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for him. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage races death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore expected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved his arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their anguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave Paganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they not the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished even from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John Mangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary Grant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that terrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or slavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful courage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors, armed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the natives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity of food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to grief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless the hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the same. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have abandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a gleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon the chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in reality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenar",

      "text": "Let us go down,\" cried he, \"before our only way of escape is blocked up.\" But just as the ladies rose by a final effort, MacNabb stopped them, and said: \"It is useless, Glenarvan. Look!\" And all saw, indeed, that an inexplicable change had taken place in the movements of the Maoris. Their pursuit had been suddenly interrupted. Their ascent of the mountain had ceased, as if by an imperious interdict. The crowd of natives had checked their swiftness, and halted, like the waves of the sea before an impassable rock. All the savages, thirsting for blood, were now ranged along the foot of the mountain, yelling, gesticulating, and brandishing guns and hatchets; but they did not advance a single foot. Their dogs, like themselves, as though chained to earth, howled with rage. What was the difficulty? What invisible power restrained the natives? The fugitives gazed without comprehending, fearing that the charm that enchained Kai-Koumou's tribe would dissolve. Suddenly Captain Mangles uttered a cry that caused his companions to turn. He pointed to a little fortress at the summit of the peak. \"The tomb of the chief Kara-Tété!\" cried Robert. \"Are you in earnest?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Yes, my lord, it is the tomb; I recognize it.\" Robert was right. Fifty feet above, at the extreme point of the mountain, stood a small palisaded inclosure of freshly-painted stakes. Glenarvan, likewise, recognized the sepulchre of the Maori chief. In their wanderings they had come to the top of the Maunganamu, where Kara-Tété had been buried. Followed by his companions, he climbed the sides of the peak, to the very foot of the tomb. A large opening, covered with mats, formed the entrance. Glenarvan was about to enter, when, all at once, he started back suddenly. \"A savage!\" said he. \"A savage in this tomb?\" inquired the major. \"Yes, MacNabb.\" \"What matter? Let us enter.\" Glenarvan, the major, Robert, and Captain Mangles passed into the inclosure. A Maori was there, clad in a great flax mantle. The darkness of the sepulchre did not permit them to distinguish his features. He appeared very calm, and was eating his breakfast with the most perfect indifference. Glenarvan was about to address him, when the native, anticipating him, said, in an amiable tone, and in excellent English: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\" It was Paganel. At his voice all rushed into the tomb, and gazed with wonder at the worthy geographer. Paganel was found! The common safety was represented in him. They were going to question him: they wished to know how and why he was on the top of the mountain; but Glenarvan checked this unseasonable curiosity. [Illustration: \"Be seated, my dear lord; breakfast is awaiting you.\"] \"The savages!\" said he. \"The savages,\" replied Paganel, shrugging his shoulders, \"are individuals whom I supremely despise.\" \"But can they not----?\" \"They! the imbeciles! Come and see them.\" Each followed Paganel, who issued from the tomb. The Maoris were in the same place, surrounding the foot of the peak, and uttering terrible cries. \"Cry and howl till you are tired, miserable creatures!\" said Paganel. \"I defy you to climb this mountain!\" \"And why?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Because the chief is buried here; this tomb protects us, and the mountain is tabooed.\" \"Tabooed?\" \"Yes, my friends; and that is why I took refuge here, as in one of those asylums of the Middle Ages, open to unfortunates.\" Indeed, the mountain was tabooed, and by this consecration had become inaccessible by the superstitious savages. The safety of the fugitives was not yet certain, but there was a salutary respite, of which they strove to take advantage. Glenarvan, a prey to unspeakable emotion, did not venture a word; while the major nodded his head with an air of genuine satisfaction. \"And now, my friends,\" said Paganel, \"if these brutes expect us to test their patience they are mistaken. In two days we shall be beyond the reach of these rascals.\" \"We will escape!\" said Glenarvan; \"but how?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Paganel, \"but we will do so all the same.\" All now wished to hear the geographer's adventures. Strangely enough, in the case of a man loquacious usually, it was necessary to draw, as it were, the words from his mouth. He, who was so fond of telling stories, replied only in an evasive way to the questions of his friends. \"Paganel has changed,\" thought MacNabb. [Sidenote: THE WORTH OF SPECTACLES.] Indeed, the countenance of the geographer was no longer the same. He wrapped himself gloomily in his great flaxen mantle, and seemed to shun too inquisitive looks. However, when they were all seated around him at the foot of the tomb, he related his experiences. After the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert, of the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less fortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris, who were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance, who was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief spoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose against that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should consider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step without being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how matters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The spectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he attached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by strong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly treated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he was a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture, his condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate friends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting as",

Poor Mary Grant felt herself growing weak, and Captain Mangles supported her, ready to die in her defence. The others endured this torrent of invectives in various ways, either indifferent like the major, or increasingly annoyed like Paganel. Glenarvan, wishing to relieve Lady Helena from the assaults of these shrews, boldly approached Kai-Koumou, and, pointing to the hideous throng, said: \"Drive them away!\" The Maori chief gazed steadily at his prisoner without replying. Then with a gesture he silenced the noisy horde. Glenarvan bowed in token of thanks, and slowly resumed his place among his friends. Kai-Koumou, fearing an insurrection of the fanatics of his tribe, now led his captives to a sacred place, situated at the other end of the pah, on the edge of a precipice. This hut rested against a rock that rose a hundred feet above it and was a steep boundary to this side of the fortification. In this consecrated temple the priests, or \"arikis,\" instruct the New Zealanders. The building was spacious and tightly closed, and contained the holy and chosen food of the god. Here the prisoners, temporarily sheltered from the fury of the natives, stretched themselves on the flax mats. Lady Helena, her strength exhausted and her energy overcome, sank into her husband's arms. Glenarvan pressed her to his breast, and said: \"Courage, my dear Helena; Heaven will not forsake us!\" Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening between the roof and the wall, where strings of pipes were hanging. From this point his view commanded the whole extent of the pah, as far as Kai-Koumou's hut. \"They have gathered around the chief,\" said he, in a low voice. \"They are waving their arms, and howling. Kai-Koumou is going to speak.\" The boy was silent for a few moments, then continued: \"Kai-Koumou is speaking. The savages grow calm; they listen.\" \"This chief,\" said the major, \"has evidently a personal interest in protecting us. He wishes to exchange his prisoners for some chiefs of his tribe. But will his warriors consent?\" \"Yes, they are listening to him,\" continued Robert. \"They are dispersing; some return to their huts,--others leave the fortification.\" \"Is it really so?\" cried the major. \"Yes, Mr. MacNabb,\" replied Robert. \"Kai-Koumou remains alone with the warriors that were in the canoe. Ha! one of them is coming towards us!\" [Illustration: Robert was scarcely within the hut before he climbed on Wilson's shoulders, and succeeded in thrusting his head through an opening.] \"Get down, Robert,\" said Glenarvan. At this moment Lady Helena, who had risen, seized her husband's arm. \"Edward,\" said she, in a firm voice, \"neither Mary Grant nor I shall fall alive into the hands of those savages!\" And, so saying, she presented to her husband a loaded revolver. \"A weapon!\" exclaimed Glenarvan, whose eyes suddenly brightened. \"Yes. The Maoris do not search their female prisoners; but this weapon is for us, Edward, not for them.\" \"Glenarvan,\" said MacNabb quickly, \"hide the revolver. It is not time yet.\" The weapon was immediately concealed in his clothes. The mat that closed the entrance of the hut was raised. A native appeared. He made a sign to the captives to follow him. Glenarvan and his companions passed through the pah, and stopped before Kai-Koumou. Around him were assembled the principal warriors of his tribe, among whom was seen the chief whose canoe had first joined Kai-Koumou on the river. He was a man of about forty, robust, and of fierce and cruel aspect. His name was Kara-Tété, which means in the native language \"The Irascible.\" Kai-Koumou treated him with some respect, and from the delicacy of his tattooing it was evident that he occupied a high rank in his tribe. An observer, however, would have detected a rivalry between the two chiefs. The major, indeed, perceived that Kara-Tété's influence surpassed that of Kai-Koumou. They both ruled the powerful tribes of the Waikato with equal rank; and, during this interview, although Kai-Koumou smiled, his eyes betrayed a deep hostility. He now questioned Glenarvan. \"You are English?\" said he. \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, without hesitation, for this nationality would probably facilitate an exchange. [Sidenote: THE RATE OF BARTER.] \"And your companions?\" asked Kai-Koumou. \"My companions are also English. We are shipwrecked travelers, and, if you care to know, we have taken no part in the war.\" \"No matter,\" replied Kara-Tété, brutally. \"Every Englishman is our enemy. Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages.\" \"They have done wrong,\" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. \"I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power.\" \"Listen,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken.\" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: \"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply,",

The French ships being greatly out of repair, Marion was induced to fell timber at some distance in the interior, and to establish in this occupation a great number of his men, going frequently to them, and remaining with them and the apparently friendly chiefs. On one of these occasions the Maoris fulfilled their revengeful project with a terrible satisfaction to themselves. Only one man, of all those in the interior, managed to escape, the commander himself falling a prey to their vengeance. They then endeavored to kill the second in command, who, with several others, was nearer to the shore. These, of course, at once started for their boats; breathless, they reached them, hotly pursued to the water's edge by the insatiate savages. Then, safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the chief, and the previous exultation of the aborigines was, even in the hour of their triumph, turned to lamentation, coupled with wonder at the terrible power of the white man's fire-barrel. [Illustration: Safe themselves, the French marksmen picked off the chief.] All this and much more did the geographer narrate; but it must be confessed that he neither spoke, nor did they listen, with the complacency evinced in his previous tales. Besides, their surroundings were at the time uncomfortable, and the first prognostications of a speedy passage were not likely to be verified. Unfortunately, this painful voyage was prolonged. Six days after her departure, the Macquarie had not descried the shores of Auckland. The wind was fair, however, and still blew from the southwest; but nevertheless the brig did not make much headway. The sea was rough, the rigging creaked, the ribs cracked, and the vessel rode the waves with difficulty. Fortunately, Will Halley, like a man who was in no hurry, did not crowd on sail, or his masts would inevitably have snapped. Captain Mangles hoped, therefore, that this clumsy craft would reach its destination in safety; still, he was pained to see his companions on board in such miserable quarters. [Sidenote: PERSISTENT GRIEF.] But neither Lady Helena nor Mary Grant complained, although the continual rain kept them confined, and the want of air and rolling of the ship seriously incommoded them. Their friends sought to divert them, and Paganel strove to while the time with his stories, but did not succeed so well as previously. Of all the passengers, the one most to be pitied was Lord Glenarvan. They rarely saw him below; he could not keep still. His nervous and excitable nature would not submit to an imprisonment between four wooden walls. Day and night, heedless of the torrents of rain and the dashing spray of the sea, he remained on deck, sometimes bending over the rail, sometimes pacing up and down with feverish agitation. His eyes gazed continually into space, and, during the brief lulls, his glass persistently surveyed the horizon. He seemed to question the mute waves; the mist that veiled the sky, the masses of vapor, he would have penetrated with a glance; he could not be resigned, and his countenance betokened an acute grief. The power and hopefulness of this man, hitherto so energetic and courageous, had suddenly failed. Captain Mangles seldom left him, but at his side endured the severity of the storm. That day, Glenarvan, wherever there was an opening in the mist, scanned the horizon with the utmost persistency. The young captain approached him. \"Is your lordship looking for land?\" he asked. Glenarvan shook his head. \"It will yet be some time before we leave the brig. We ought to have sighted Auckland light thirty-six hours ago.\" Glenarvan did not answer. He still gazed, and for a moment his glass was pointed towards the horizon to windward of the vessel. \"The land is not on that side,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Your lordship should look towards the starboard.\" \"Why, John?\" replied Glenarvan. \"It is not the land that I am seeking.\" \"What is it, my lord?\" [Sidenote: A COURAGEOUS CAPTAIN.] \"My yacht, my Duncan! She must be here, in these regions, plowing these seas, in that dreadful employment of a pirate. She is here, I tell you, John, on this course between Australia and New Zealand! I have a presentiment that we shall meet her!\" [Illustration: Day and night, heedless of the torrents of rain and the dashing spray of the sea, he remained on deck.] \"God preserve us from such a meeting, my lord!\" \"Why, John?\" \"Your lordship forgets our situation. What could we do on this brig, if the Duncan should give us chase? We could not escape.\" \"Escape, John?\" \"Yes, my lord. We should try in vain. We should be captured, at the mercy of the wretches. Ben Joyce has shown that he does not hesitate at a crime. I should sell my life dearly. We would defend ourselves to the last extremity. Well! But, then, think of Lady Helena and Mary Grant!\" \"Poor women!\" murmured Glenarvan. \"John, my heart is broken, and sometimes I feel as if despair had invaded it. It seems to me as if new calamities awaited us, as if Heaven had decreed against us! I am afraid!\" \"You, my lord?\" \"Not for myself, John, but for those whom I love, and whom you love also.\" \"Take courage, my lord,\" replied the young captain. \"We need no longer fear. The Macquarie is a poor sailer, but still she sails. Will Halley is a brutish creature; but I am here, and if the approach to the land seems to me dangerous I shall take the ship to sea again. Therefore from this quarter there is little or no danger. But as for meeting the Duncan, God preserve us, and enable us to escape!\" Captain Mangles was right. To encounter the Duncan would be fatal to the Macquarie, and this misfortune was to be feared in these retired seas, where pirates could roam without danger. However, that day, at least, the Duncan did not appear, and the sixth night since their departure from Twofold Bay arrived without Captain Mangles's fears being realized.

The mildness of the climate justified this light costume. Each of these young soldiers carried a gun and a sword, which were too long and heavy for the little fellows. All had a certain family resemblance, and the corporal who commanded resembled them too: they were twelve brothers, who were parading under the orders of the thirteenth. [Sidenote: AN ARGENTINE COMMANDANT.] Paganel was not astonished. He remembered his Argentine statistics, and knew that in this country the average number of children in a family exceeds nine. But what surprised him exceedingly was to see these little soldiers practicing the French tactics, and to hear the orders of the corporal given in his own native language. \"This is singular,\" said he. But Glenarvan had not come to see boys drill, still less to occupy himself with their nationality or relationship. He did not, therefore, give Paganel time to express further astonishment, but besought him to ask for the commander of the fortress. Paganel did so, and one of the soldiers proceeded towards a small building which served as the barracks. A few moments after, the commander appeared in person. He was a man of fifty, robust, with a military air, thick whiskers, prominent cheek-bones, gray hair, and commanding look, so far as one could judge through the clouds of smoke that issued from his short pipe. Thalcave, addressing him, introduced Lord Glenarvan and his companions. While he spoke, the commander kept scrutinizing Paganel with quite embarrassing persistence. The geographer did not know what the trooper meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- \"A Frenchman?\" \"Yes, a Frenchman,\" replied Paganel. \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. \"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel. \"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts of the world!\" [Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced to Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if this expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he owed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey across the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned the country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores, and those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed, he either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which was afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the republic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal struggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion of the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern part of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was a prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the northern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt a perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the Pampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant, and the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at each other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the caziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to recollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in",

Let us improve the opportunity, and, if your lordship pleases, it shall be an exciting scene as well as a good action.\" \"Very well, captain,\" said Lord Glenarvan. He then summoned Lady Helena, who joined him on deck, tempted by the exciting sport. The sea was magnificent. You could easily follow along its surface the rapid motions of the fish, as it plunged and rose again with surprising agility. Captain Mangles gave his orders, and the sailors threw over the starboard ratling a stout rope, to which was fastened a hook baited with a thick piece of pork. [Sidenote: THE LAST MOUTHFUL.] The shark, although still at a distance of fifty yards, scented the bait offered to his voracity. He rapidly approached the yacht. You could see his fins, gray at their extremity and black at their base, beat the waves with violence, while his \"caudal appendage\" kept him in a rigorously straight line. As he advanced, his great glaring eyes seemed inflamed with eagerness, and his yawning jaws, when he turned, disclosed a quadruple row of teeth. His head was large, and shaped like a double-headed hammer. Captain Mangles was right. It was a very large specimen of the most rapacious family of sharks,--the \"balance fish\" of the English and the \"jew-fish\" of the Provençals. [Illustration] All on board of the Duncan followed the movements of the shark with lively attention. The animal was soon within reach of the hook; he turned upon his back, in order to seize it better, and the enormous bait disappeared down his vast gullet. At the same time he hooked himself, giving the line a violent shake, whereupon the sailors hoisted the huge creature by means of a pulley at the end of the yard-arm. The shark struggled violently at feeling himself drawn from his natural element, but his struggles were of no avail. A rope with a slip-noose confined his tail and paralyzed his movements. A few moments afterward he was hauled over the ratlings, and precipitated upon the deck of the yacht. One of the sailors at once approached him, not without caution, and with a vigorous blow of the hatchet cut off the formidable tail of the animal. The chase was ended, and there was nothing more to fear from the monster. The vengeance of the sailors was satisfied, but not their curiosity. Indeed, it is customary on board of every vessel to carefully examine the stomachs of sharks. The men, knowing the inordinate voracity of the creature, wait with some anxiety, and their expectation is not always in vain. Lady Glenarvan, not wishing to witness this strange \"exploration,\" retired to the cabin. The shark was still panting. He was ten feet long, and weighed more than six hundred pounds. These dimensions are nothing extraordinary; for if the balance-fish is not classed among the giants of this species, at least he belongs to the most formidable of their family. The enormous fish was soon cut open by a blow of the hatchet, without further ceremony. The hook had penetrated to the stomach, which was absolutely empty. Evidently the animal had fasted a long time, and the disappointed seamen were about to cast the remains into the sea, when the attention of the mate was attracted by a bulky object firmly imbedded in the viscera. \"Ha! what is this?\" he exclaimed. \"That,\" replied one of the sailors, \"is a piece of rock that the creature has taken in for ballast.\" \"Good!\" said another; \"it is probably a bullet that this fellow has received in the stomach, and could not digest.\" [Illustration: \"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the cabin.\"] \"Be still, all of you!\" cried Tom Austin, the mate; \"do you not see that the animal was a great drunkard? and to lose nothing, has drank not only the wine, but the bottle too!\" \"What!\" exclaimed Lord Glenarvan, \"is it a bottle that this shark has in his stomach?\" \"A real bottle!\" replied the mate, \"but you can easily see that it does not come from the wine-cellar.\" \"Well, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"draw it out carefully. Bottles found in the sea frequently contain precious documents.\" \"Do you think so?\" said Major MacNabb. \"I do; at least, that it may happen so.\" \"Oh! I do not contradict you,\" replied the major. \"Perhaps there may be a secret in this.\" \"We shall see,\" said Glenarvan. \"Well, Tom?\" \"Here it is,\" said the mate, displaying the shapeless object that he had just drawn with difficulty from the interior of the shark. \"Good,\" said Glenarvan; \"wash the dirty thing, and bring it into the cabin.\" Tom obeyed; and the bottle found under such singular circumstances was placed on the cabin-table, around which Lord Glenarvan, Major MacNabb, and Captain John Mangles took their seats, together with Lady Helena; for a woman, they say, is always a little inquisitive. Everything causes excitement at sea. For a moment there was silence. Each gazed wonderingly at this strange waif. Did it contain the secret of a disaster, or only an insignificant message confided to the mercy of the waves by some idle navigator? [Sidenote: \"OLD IN BOTTLE.\"] However, they must know what it was, and Glenarvan, without waiting longer, proceeded to examine the bottle. He took, moreover, all necessary precautions. You would have thought a coroner was pointing out the particulars of a suspicious quest. And Glenarvan was right, for the most insignificant mark in appearance may often lead to an important discovery. Before examining it internally, the bottle was inspected externally. It had a slender neck, the mouth of which was protected by an iron wire considerably rusted. Its sides were very thick, and capable of supporting a pressure of several atmospheres, betraying evidently previous connection with champagne. With these bottles the wine-dressers of Aï and Epernay block carriage-wheels without their showing the slightest fracture. This one could, therefore, easily bear the hardships of a long voyage. [Illustration] \"A bottle of the Maison Cliquot,\" said the major quietly; and, as if he ought to know, his affirmation was accepted without contradiction. \"My dear major,\" said Lady Helena, \"it matters little what this bottle is, provided we know whence it comes.\" \"",

      "text": " I expect, or even fails, our situation will not be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has made this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help us to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become the victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon us, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he will abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The avenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only ask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own advantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being consumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the tomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till the savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant, \"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that. The mountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the taboo will be still more rigorous.\" \"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is only one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist in remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail us. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part skillfully.\" \"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena. \"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest darkness.\" \"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although from habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your success. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them that will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries pardon us!\" Paganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the superstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed. It only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice difficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should dig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the vapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf the entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those phenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than theirs. Paganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act prudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to deceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption. How long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours. Everything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had been divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the fire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light baggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded inclosure and unknown to the savages. At six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they should eat in the valleys no one could foretell. Twilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of threatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant peal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed the storm that came to the aid of his design. At eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding darkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background to the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The Maoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had come. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, the steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously. The place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb. It was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption, for otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed an enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour forth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural crater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the subterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke and lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening. [Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.] The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and with these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their united efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of groove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an inclined plane. As their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more violent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin crust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the underground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts of hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous. But a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of the mountain and disappeared. The thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys below. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that it was disappearing in a general conflagration. Glenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of the eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without receiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled a strong sulphureous odor. Then mud, lava, and volcanic fragments mingled in the scene of devastation. Torrents of flame furrowed the sides of the Maungan",
