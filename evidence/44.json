At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate would be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain, if you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his intended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their places beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain Mangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered so severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did not yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a profound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his teeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing displayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord Glenarvan's presence, he folded his arms, and calmly and silently waited to be questioned: \"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, \"here we all are, as you see, on board the Duncan, that you would have surrendered to Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" At these words the lips of the quartermaster slightly trembled. A quick blush colored his hard features,--not the sign of remorse, but the shame of defeat. He was prisoner on this yacht that he had meant to command as master, and his fate was soon to be decided. However, he made no reply. Glenarvan waited patiently, but Ayrton still persisted in maintaining an obstinate silence. \"Speak, Ayrton; what have you to say?\" continued Glenarvan. The convict hesitated, and the lines of his forehead were strongly contracted. At last he said, in a calm voice: \"I have nothing to say, my lord. I was foolish enough to let myself be taken. Do what you please.\" [Sidenote: A DUMB PRISONER.] Having given his answer, the quartermaster turned his eyes toward the coast that extended along the west, and affected a profound indifference for all that was passing around him. You would have thought, to look at him, that he was a stranger to this serious affair. But Glenarvan had resolved to be patient. A powerful motive urged him to ascertain certain circumstances of Ayrton's mysterious life, especially as regarded Harry Grant and the Britannia. He therefore resumed his inquiries, speaking with extreme mildness, and imposing the most perfect calmness upon the violent agitation of his heart. \"I hope, Ayrton,\" continued he, \"that you will not refuse to answer certain questions that I desire to ask you. And, first, am I to call you Ayrton or Ben Joyce? Are you the quartermaster of the Britannia?\" Ayrton remained unmoved, watching the coast, deaf to every question. Glenarvan, whose eye flashed with some inward emotion, continued to question him. \"Will you tell me how you left the Britannia, and why you were in Australia?\" There was the same silence, the same obstinacy. \"Listen to me, Ayrton,\" resumed Glenarvan. \"It is for your interest to speak. We may reward a frank confession, which is your only resort. For the last time, will you answer my questions?\" Ayrton turned his head towards Glenarvan, and looked him full in the face. \"My lord,\" said he, \"I have nothing to answer. It is for justice to prove against me.\" \"The proofs will be easy,\" replied Glenarvan. [Sidenote: USELESS APPEALS.] \"Easy, my lord?\" continued the quartermaster, in a sneering tone. \"Your lordship seems to me very hasty. I declare that the best judge in Westminster Hall would be puzzled to establish my identity. Who can say why I came to Australia, since Captain Grant is no longer here to inform you? Who can prove that I am that Ben Joyce described by the police, since they have never laid hands upon me, and my companions are at liberty? Who, except you, can charge me, not to say with a crime, but even with a culpable action?\" [Illustration: Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs.] Ayrton had grown animated while speaking, but soon relapsed into his former indifference. He doubtless imagined that this declaration would end the examination: but Glenarvan resumed, and said: \"Ayrton, I am not a judge charged with trying you. This is not my business. It is important that our respective positions should be clearly defined. I ask nothing that can implicate you, for that is the part of justice. But you know what search I am pursuing, and, with a word, you can put me on the track I have lost. Will you speak?\" Ayrton shook his head, like a man determined to keep silent. \"Will you tell me where Captain Grant is?\" asked Glenarvan. \"No, my lord.\" \"Will you point out where the Britannia was wrecked?\" \"Certainly not.\" \"Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, in almost a suppliant tone, \"will you, at least, if you know where Captain Grant is, tell his poor children, who are only waiting for a word from your lips?\" The quartermaster hesitated; his features quivered; but, in a low voice, he muttered: \"I cannot, my lord.\" Then, as if he reproached himself for a moment's weakness, he added, angrily: \"No, I will not speak! Hang me if you will!\" \"Hang, then!\" cried Glenarvan, overcome by a sudden feeling of indignation. But finally controlling himself, he said, in a grave voice: \"There are neither judges nor hangmen here. At the first landing-place you shall be put into the hands of the English authorities.\" \"Just what I desire,\" replied the quartermaster. Thereupon he was taken back to the cabin that served as his prison, and two sailors were stationed at the door, with orders to watch all his movements. The witnesses of this scene retired",

The quartermaster made his preparations for departure, aided by the two sailors, one of whom attended to his horse, and the other to his provisions. Meantime Glenarvan wrote the letter designed for Tom Austin. He ordered the mate of the Duncan to repair without delay to Twofold Bay, and recommended the quartermaster to him as a man in whom he could place entire confidence. As soon as he arrived at the bay, he was to send a detachment of sailors under the command of Ayrton. He had just reached this part of his letter, when the major, who had been looking over his shoulder, asked him, in a singular tone, how he wrote the word Ayrton. \"As it is pronounced,\" replied Glenarvan. \"That is a mistake,\" said the major coolly. \"It is pronounced Ayrton, but it is written 'Ben Joyce'!\" CHAPTER XLI. THE PLOT UNVEILED. The sound of the name of Ben Joyce fell upon the party like a thunderbolt. Ayrton suddenly sprang to his feet. In his hand was a revolver. A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet. Before Captain Mangles and the sailors recovered from the surprise into which this unexpected turn of affairs had thrown them, the audacious convict had escaped, and joined his band, scattered along the edge of the wood of gum-trees. [Illustration: A report was heard; and Glenarvan fell, struck by a bullet.] The tent did not offer a sufficient shelter against the bullets, and it was clearly necessary to beat a retreat. Glenarvan, who was but slightly injured, had risen. \"To the cart! to the cart!\" cried Captain Mangles, as he hurried on Lady Helena and Mary Grant, who were soon in safety behind its stout sides. The captain, the major, Paganel, and the sailors then seized their rifles, and stood ready to repel the convicts. Glenarvan and Robert had joined the ladies, while Olbinett hastened to the common defence. These events had transpired with the rapidity of lightning. Captain Mangles attentively watched the edge of the wood; but the reports suddenly ceased on the arrival of Ben Joyce, and a profound silence succeeded the noisy fusillade. A few wreaths of white smoke were still curling up between the branches of the gum-trees, but the tall tufts of gastrolobium were motionless and all signs of attack had disappeared. The major and Captain Mangles extended their examinations as far as the great trees. The place was abandoned. Numerous footprints were seen, and a few half-burnt cartridges smoked on the ground. The major, like a prudent man, extinguished them, for a spark was enough to kindle a formidable conflagration in this forest of dry trees. \"The convicts have disappeared,\" said Captain Mangles. \"Yes,\" replied the major; \"and this disappearance alarms me. I should prefer to meet them face to face. It is better to encounter a tiger in the open plain than a serpent in the grass. Let us search these bushes around the cart.\" [Sidenote: UNRAVELINGS.] The major and captain scoured the surrounding country. But from the edge of the wood to the banks of the Snowy they did not meet with a single convict. Ben Joyce's band seemed to have flown away, like a flock of mischievous birds. This disappearance was too strange to inspire a perfect security. They therefore resolved to keep on the watch. The cart, which was a really immovable fortress, became the centre of the encampment, and two men kept guard, relieving each other every hour. Lady Helena and Mary Grant's first care had been to dress Glenarvan's wound. At the very moment that her husband fell, from Ben Joyce's bullet, in her terror she had rushed towards him. Then, controlling her emotion, this courageous woman had assisted Glenarvan to the cart. Here the shoulder of the wounded man was laid bare, and the major perceived that the ball had lacerated the flesh, causing no other injury. Neither bones nor large muscles seemed affected. The wound bled considerably, but Glenarvan, by moving the fingers of his hand and fore-arm, encouraged his friends to expect a favorable result. When his wound was dressed, he no longer desired any attention, and explanations followed. The travelers, except Wilson and Mulready, who were keeping guard outside, had taken seats as well as possible in the cart, and the major was requested to speak. Before beginning his story, he informed Lady Helena of the escape of a band of convicts from Perth, their appearance in the province of Victoria, and their complicity in the railway disaster. He gave her the number of the _Australian and New Zealand Gazette_ purchased at Seymour, and added that the police had set a price on the head of Ben Joyce, a formidable bandit, whom eighteen months of crime had given a wide-spread notoriety. But how had MacNabb recognized this Ben Joyce in the quartermaster Ayrton? Here was the mystery that all wished to solve; and the major explained. Since the day of his meeting with Ayrton he had suspected him. Two or three almost insignificant circumstances, a glance exchanged between the quartermaster and the farrier at Wimerra River, Ayrton's hesitation to pass through the towns and villages, his strong wish to order the Duncan to the coast, the strange death of the animals confided to his care, and, finally, a want of frankness in his actions,--all these facts, gradually noticed, had roused the major's suspicions. However, he could form no direct accusation until the events that had transpired the preceding night. Gliding between the tall clumps of shrubbery, as was related in the previous chapter, he approached near the suspicious shadows that had attracted his attention half a mile from the encampment. The phosphorescent plants cast their pale rays through the darkness. Three men were examining some tracks on the ground, and among them he recognized the farrier of Black Point Station. \"Here they are,\" said one. \"Yes,\" replied another, \"here is the trefoil of the hoofs again.\" \"It has been like this since leaving the Wimerra.\" \"All the horses are dead.\" \"The poison is not far away.\" \"There is enough here to settle an entire troop of cavalry. This gastrolobium is a useful plant.\" \"Then they were silent,\" added MacNabb, \"and departed. I wanted to know more: I followed them. The conversation soon began again. 'A cunning man, this",

Your advice, Ayrton, would be particularly valuable, and I should be much obliged if you would give it to us.\" The sailor reflected a few moments, and then replied: \"I thank you, my lord, for the confidence you place in me, and hope to show myself worthy of it. I have some knowledge of the country, and of the customs of the natives; and, if I can be of use to you----\" \"Certainly,\" replied Glenarvan. \"I think, like you,\" continued Ayrton, \"that Captain Grant and his two sailors were saved from the shipwreck; but, since they have not reached the English possessions, since they have not reappeared, I doubt not that their fate was the same as my own, and that they are prisoners of the natives.\" \"You repeat, Mr. Ayrton, the arguments that I have already substantiated,\" said Paganel. \"The shipwrecked seamen are evidently prisoners of the natives, as they feared. But ought we to suppose that, like you, they have been carried to the north?\" \"It is quite likely, sir,\" replied Ayrton. \"The hostile tribes would hardly remain in the neighborhood of the English provinces.\" \"This fact will complicate our search,\" said Glenarvan, quite disconcerted. \"How shall we find the traces of the prisoners in the interior of so vast a continent?\" A prolonged silence followed this remark. Lady Helena frequently cast a questioning glance at her companions, but without eliciting a responsive sign. Paganel himself was silent, contrary to his custom. His usual ingenuity now failed him. Captain Mangles paced the room with long strides, as if he had been on the deck of his vessel, involved in some difficulty. \"And you, Mr. Ayrton,\" said Lady Helena, at length, to the quartermaster, \"what would you do?\" \"Madam,\" replied he, promptly, \"I should re-embark on board the Duncan, and go straight to the place of the shipwreck. There I should act according to circumstances, or indications that chance might furnish.\" \"Very good,\" said Glenarvan; \"but we must wait till the Duncan is repaired.\" \"Ah! you have suffered injuries?\" inquired Ayrton. \"Yes,\" replies the captain. \"Serious?\" \"No; but they necessitate repairs which cannot be made on board. One of the flanges of the screw is bent, and this work can be done only at Melbourne.\" \"Can you not sail?\" asked the quartermaster. \"Yes; but, if the wind is contrary, it would take considerable time to reach Twofold Bay, and at any rate we should have to return to Melbourne.\" \"Well, let the yacht go to Melbourne,\" said Paganel, \"and we will go without her to Twofold Bay.\" \"But how?\" \"By crossing Australia, as we crossed South America.\" \"But the Duncan?\" added Ayrton, with singular persistency. \"The Duncan will join us, or we will join her, according to circumstances. If Captain Grant is found during our journey, we will return together to Melbourne. If, on the contrary, we continue our search to the coast, the Duncan shall join us there. Who has any objections to make to this plan? Have you, major?\" \"No,\" replied MacNabb, \"if it is practicable.\" \"So practicable,\" said Paganel, \"that I propose that Lady Helena and Miss Grant accompany us.\" \"Do you speak seriously, Paganel?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Quite seriously, my lord. It is a journey of three hundred and fifty miles. At the rate of twelve miles a day it would last scarcely a month,--long enough to give time for repairing the Duncan.\" \"But the ferocious animals?\" said Glenarvan, wishing to state all possible objections. [Sidenote: OBSTACLES EXPLAINED AWAY.] \"There are none in Australia.\" \"But the savages?\" \"There are none in the course we shall take.\" \"Well, then, the convicts?\" \"There are no convicts in the southern provinces of Australia, but only in the eastern colonies.\" \"Mr. Paganel is perfectly right,\" said O'Moore; \"they have all left the southern provinces. Since I have lived on this farm, I have not heard of one.\" \"And, for my part, I never met one,\" added Ayrton. \"You see, my friends,\" continued Paganel, \"that there are few savages, no wild beasts, and no convicts. There are not many countries of Europe of which we could say as much. Well, is it agreed?\" \"What do you think, Helena?\" asked Glenarvan. \"What we all think,\" replied she, turning towards her companions. \"Forward!\" CHAPTER XXXII. PREPARATIONS FOR THE JOURNEY. It was not Glenarvan's habit to lose time in adopting and executing a plan. As soon as Paganel's proposal was accepted, he at once resolved that the preparations for the journey should be completed as soon as possible. And what was to be the result of this search? The existence of Harry Grant seemed to have become undeniable, which increased the probabilities of success. No one expected to find the captain exactly on the line of the thirty-seventh parallel; but perhaps they would come upon traces of him, and, at all events, their course would bring them straight to the scene of the shipwreck, which was the principal point. Moreover, if Ayrton would consent to join the travelers, to guide them through the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance of success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was therefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain Grant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for him to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented, though not without regret at losing so good an assistant. \"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the Britannia?\" The quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for a few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said: \"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the track of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where his vessel was wrecked.\" \"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan. \"One question, my lord.\" \"Ask it.\" \"Where will you",

Moreover, when Ayrton left them they did not appear to have succeeded, and their faces betokened real despair. [Illustration: He contented himself with shrugging his shoulders, which so increased the rage of the crew, that nothing less than the intervention of the captain and his lordship could restrain them.] When the quartermaster was taken back to his cabin, therefore, the sailors saluted his appearance with violent threats. But he contented himself with shrugging his shoulders, which so increased the rage of the crew, that nothing less than the intervention of the captain and his lordship could restrain them. But Lady Helena did not consider herself defeated. She wished to struggle to the last with this heartless man, and the next day she went herself to Ayrton's cabin, to avoid the scene that his appearance on deck occasioned. For two long hours this kind and gentle Scotch lady remained alone face to face with the chief of the convicts. Glenarvan, a prey to nervous agitation, lingered near the cabin, now determined to thoroughly exhaust the chances of success, and now upon the point of drawing his wife away from this painful and prolonged interview. But this time, when Lady Helena reappeared, her features inspired confidence. Had she, then, brought this secret to light, and stirred the dormant feeling of pity in the heart of this poor creature? MacNabb, who saw her first, could not repress a very natural feeling of incredulity. However, the rumor soon spread among the crew that the quartermaster had at length yielded to Lady Helena's entreaties. All the sailors assembled on deck more quickly than if Tom Austin's whistle had summoned them. \"Has he spoken?\" asked Lord Glenarvan of his wife. \"No,\" replied Lady Helena; \"but in compliance with my entreaties he desires to see you.\" \"Ah, dear Helena, you have succeeded!\" \"I hope so, Edward.\" \"Have you made any promise that I am to sanction?\" \"Only one: that you will use all your influence to moderate the fate in store for him.\" [Sidenote: VERY BUSINESS-LIKE.] \"Certainly, my dear Helena. Let him come to me immediately.\" Lady Helena retired to her cabin, accompanied by Mary Grant, and the quartermaster was taken to the saloon where Glenarvan awaited him. CHAPTER LVII. A DISCOURAGING CONFESSION. As soon as the quartermaster was in Lord Glenarvan's presence his custodians retired. \"You desired to speak to me, Ayrton?\" said Glenarvan. \"Yes, my lord,\" replied he. \"To me alone?\" \"Yes; but I think that if Major MacNabb and Mr. Paganel were present at the interview it would be better.\" \"For whom?\" \"For me.\" Ayrton spoke calmly. Glenarvan gazed at him steadily, and then sent word to MacNabb and Paganel, who at once obeyed his summons. \"We are ready for you,\" said Glenarvan, as soon as his two friends were seated at the cabin-table. Ayrton reflected for a few moments, and then said: \"My lord, it is customary for witnesses to be present at every contract or negotiation between two parties. That is why I requested the presence of Mr. Paganel and Major MacNabb; for, properly speaking, this is a matter of business that I am going to propose to you.\" Glenarvan, who was accustomed to Ayrton's manners, betrayed no surprise, although a matter of business between this man and himself seemed strange. [Illustration: \"Do you agree or not?\"] [Sidenote: BARGAINING FOR TERMS.] \"What is this business?\" said he. \"This is it,\" replied Ayrton. \"You desire to know from me certain circumstances which may be useful to you. I desire to obtain from you certain advantages which will be valuable to me. Now, I will make an exchange, my lord. Do you agree or not?\" \"What are these circumstances?\" asked Paganel, quickly. \"No,\" corrected Glenarvan: \"what are these advantages?\" Ayrton bowed, showing that he understood the distinction. \"These,\" said he, \"are the advantages for which I petition. You still intend, my lord, to deliver me into the hands of the English authorities?\" \"Yes, Ayrton; it is only justice.\" \"I do not deny it,\" replied the quartermaster. \"You would not consent, then, to set me at liberty?\" Glenarvan hesitated before answering a question so plainly asked. Perhaps the fate of Harry Grant depended upon what he was about to say. However, the feeling of duty towards humanity prevailed, and he said: \"No, Ayrton, I cannot set you at liberty.\" \"I do not ask it,\" replied the quartermaster, proudly. \"What do you wish, then?\" \"An intermediate fate, my lord, between that which you think awaits me and the liberty that you cannot grant me.\" \"And that is----?\" \"To abandon me on one of the desert islands of the Pacific, with the principal necessaries of life. I will manage as I can, and repent, if I have time.\" Glenarvan, who was little prepared for this proposal, glanced at his two friends, who remained silent. After a few moments of reflection, he replied: \"Ayrton, if I grant your request, will you tell me all that it is for my interest to know?\" \"Yes, my lord; that is to say, all that I know concerning Captain Grant and the Britannia.\" \"The whole truth?\" \"The whole.\" \"But who will warrant----?\" \"Oh, I see what troubles you, my lord. You do not like to trust to me,--to the word of a malefactor! That is right. But what can you do? The situation is thus. You have only to accept or refuse.\" \"I will trust you, Ayrton,\" said Glenarvan, simply. \"And you will be right, my lord. Moreover, if I deceive you, you will always have the power to revenge yourself.\" \"How?\" \"By recapturing me on this island, from which I shall not be able to escape.\" Ayrton had a reply for everything. He met all difficulties, and produced unanswerable arguments against himself. As was seen, he strove to treat in his business with good faith. It was impossible for a person to surrender with more perfect confidence, and yet he found means to advance still further in this disinterested course. \"My lord and gentlemen,\"",

But a sudden revelation dawned on the mind of each. They comprehended Mary's grief, why the tears flowed from her eyes, why the name of her father rose to her lips. The discovery of Ayrton's treachery destroyed all hope. The convict, to entice Glenarvan on, had invented a shipwreck. In their conversation, overheard by MacNabb, his accomplices had clearly confessed it. The Britannia had never been wrecked on the reefs of Twofold Bay! Harry Grant had never set foot on the Australian continent! For the second time an erroneous interpretation of the document had set the searchers of the Britannia on a false trail. All, in the face of this situation and the grief of the two children, preserved a mournful silence. Who then could have found words of hope? Robert wept in his sister's arms. Paganel murmured, in a voice of despair,-- [Sidenote: CALM AND CLOUDINESS.] \"Ah, unlucky document! You can boast of having sorely puzzled the brains of a dozen brave people!\" And the worthy geographer was fairly furious against himself, and frantically beat his forehead. In the mean time Glenarvan had joined Mulready and Wilson, who were on guard without. A deep silence reigned on the plain lying between the wood and the river. Heavy clouds covered the vault of the sky. In this deadened and torpid atmosphere the least sound would have been clearly transmitted; but nothing was heard. Ben Joyce and his band must have fled to a considerable distance; for flocks of birds that sported on the low branches of the trees, several kangaroos peacefully browsing on the young shoots, and a pair of cassowaries, whose unsuspecting heads were thrust between the tall bushes, proved that the presence of man did not disturb these peaceful solitudes. \"You have not seen nor heard anything for an hour?\" inquired Glenarvan of the two sailors. \"Nothing, my lord,\" replied Wilson. \"The convicts must be several miles away.\" \"They cannot have been in sufficient force to attack us,\" added Mulready. \"This Ben Joyce probably intended to recruit some bandits, like himself, among the bushrangers that wander at the foot of the Alps.\" \"Very likely, Mulready,\" replied Glenarvan. \"These rascals are cowards. They know we are well armed, and are perhaps waiting for darkness to commence their attack. We must redouble our vigilance at nightfall. If we could only leave this marshy plain and pursue our journey towards the coast! But the swollen waters of the river bar our progress. I would pay its weight in gold for a raft that would transport us to the other side!\" \"Why,\" said Wilson, \"does not your lordship give us the order to construct this raft? There is plenty of wood.\" \"No, Wilson,\" answered Glenarvan; \"this Snowy is not a river, it is an impassable torrent.\" [Illustration: A pair of cassowaries proved that the presence of man did not disturb these peaceful solitudes.] [Sidenote: READINESS FOR SERVICE.] At this moment Captain Mangles, the major, and Paganel joined Glenarvan. They had been to examine the Snowy. The waters, swollen by the recent rains, had risen a foot above low-water mark, and formed an impetuous current. It was impossible to venture upon this roaring deluge, these rushing floods, broken into a thousand eddies by the depressions of the river-bed. Captain Mangles declared that the passage was impracticable. \"But,\" added he, \"we ought not to remain here without making any attempt. What we wished to do before Ayrton's treason is still more necessary now.\" \"What do you say, captain?\" asked Glenarvan. \"I say that assistance is needed; and since we cannot go to Twofold Bay, we must go to Melbourne. One horse is left. Let your lordship give him to me, and I will go.\" \"But it is a perilous venture, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"Aside from the dangers of this journey of two hundred miles across an unknown country, all the roads may be guarded by Ben Joyce's accomplices.\" \"I know it, my lord; but I know, too, that our situation cannot be prolonged. Ayrton only asked eight days' absence to bring back the crew of the Duncan. But I will return in six days to the banks of the Snowy. What are your lordship's orders?\" \"Before Glenarvan speaks,\" said Paganel, \"I must make a remark. It is well that one of us should go to Melbourne, but not that these dangers should be incurred by Captain Mangles. He is the captain of the Duncan, and must not, therefore, expose himself. Allow me to go in his place.\" \"Well said,\" replied the major; \"but why should it be you, Paganel?\" \"Are we not here?\" cried Wilson and Mulready. \"And do you believe,\" continued MacNabb, \"that I am afraid to make a journey of two hundred miles on horseback?\" \"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"if one of us is to go to Melbourne, let fate decide. Paganel, write our names----\" \"Not yours at least, my lord,\" insisted Captain Mangles. \"And why?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Separate you from Lady Helena, when your wound is not yet healed?\" \"Glenarvan,\" interposed Paganel, \"you cannot leave the encampment.\" \"No,\" resumed the major; \"your place is here. Edward, you must not go.\" \"There are dangers to incur,\" replied Glenarvan; \"and I will not leave my part to others. Write, Paganel; let my name be mingled with those of my companions, and Heaven grant that it may be the first drawn.\" All yielded to this wish; and Glenarvan's name was added to the others. They then proceeded to draw, and the lot fell upon Mulready. The brave sailor uttered a cry of joy. \"My lord, I am ready to go,\" said he. Glenarvan clasped his hand, and then turned towards the cart, leaving the major and Captain Mangles to guard the encampment. Lady Helena was at once informed of the decision taken to send a messenger to Melbourne, and of the result of the drawing by lot. She spoke words to Mulready that went to the heart",

      "text": " Heaven lead you to repentance!\" \"May it be so,\" rejoined Ayrton, in a calm tone. Then Glenarvan, addressing the quartermaster, said: \"Do you still adhere, Ayrton, to this determination to be abandoned?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Does Tabor Island suit you?\" \"Perfectly.\" \"Now listen to my last words. You will be far removed from every land, and deprived of all communication with your fellow-men. Miracles are rare, and you will not probably remove from this island, where we leave you. You will be alone, under the eye of God, who reads the uttermost depths of all hearts; but you will not be lost, as was Captain Grant. However unworthy you may be of the remembrance of men, still they will remember you. I know where you are, and will never forget you.\" \"Thank you, my lord!\" replied Ayrton, simply. Such were the last words exchanged between Glenarvan and the quartermaster. The boat was ready, and Ayrton embarked. Captain Mangles had previously sent to the island several cases of preserved food, some clothes, tools, weapons, and a supply of powder and shot. The abandoned man could therefore employ his time to advantage. Nothing was wanting, not even books, foremost among which was a Bible. The hour for separation had come. The crew and passengers stood on deck. More than one felt the heart strangely moved. Lady Helena and Mary Grant could not repress their emotion. \"Must it then be so?\" inquired the young wife of her husband. \"Must this unfortunate be abandoned?\" [Sidenote: \"FAREWELL! A LONG FAREWELL!\"] \"He must, Helena,\" answered Glenarvan. \"It is his punishment.\" At this moment the boat, commanded by Captain Mangles, started. Ayrton raised his hat and gave a grave salute. Glenarvan and the crew returned this last farewell, as if to a man about to die, as he departed, in a profound silence. On reaching the shore, Ayrton leaped upon the sand, and the boat returned. It was then four o'clock in the afternoon, and from the upper deck the passengers could see the quartermaster, with folded arms, standing motionless as a statue, on a rock, and gazing at the vessel. \"Shall we start, my lord?\" asked Captain Mangles. \"Yes, John,\" replied Glenarvan, quickly, with more emotion than he wished to manifest. \"All right!\" cried the captain to the engineer. The steam hissed, the screw beat the waves, and at eight o'clock the last summits of Tabor Island disappeared in the shadows of the night. CHAPTER LX. PAGANEL'S LAST ENTANGLEMENT. Eleven days after leaving Tabor Island the Duncan came in sight of the Australian coast, and anchored in Talcahuana Bay. Five months had elapsed since her departure from this port, during which time the travelers had made the circuit of the world on this thirty-seventh parallel. Their efforts had not been in vain, for they had found the shipwrecked survivors of the Britannia. The Duncan, having taken in her necessary stores, skirted the coasts of Patagonia, doubled Cape Horn, and steamed across the Atlantic. The voyage was very uneventful. The yacht carried a full complement of happy people; there seemed to be no secrets on board. A mystery, however, still perplexed MacNabb. Why did Paganel always keep hermetically incased in his clothes, and wear a comforter over his ears? The major longed to know the motive for this singular fancy. But in spite of his questions, hints, and suspicions, Paganel did not unbutton his coat. At last, fifty-three days after leaving Talcahuana, Captain Mangles descried the lighthouse of Cape Clear. The vessel entered St. George's Channel, crossed the Irish Sea, and passed into the Frith of Clyde. At eleven o'clock they anchored at Dumbarton, and early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends. Thus it was that Harry Grant and his two companions were rescued, and that John Mangles married Mary Grant in the old cathedral of St. Mungo, where the Rev. Mr. Morton, who nine months before had prayed for the rescue of the father, now blessed the union of the daughter with one of his deliverers. It was arranged that Robert should be a sailor, like his father and brother-in-law, and that he should continue the contemplated project of the former, under the munificent patronage of Lord Glenarvan. But was Jacques Paganel to die a bachelor? Certainly not; for, after his heroic exploits, the worthy geographer could not escape celebrity. His eccentricities (and his abilities) made him much talked of in Scotland. People seemed as though they could not show him enough attention. Just at this time an amiable lady of thirty, none other than the major's cousin, a little eccentric herself, but still agreeable and charming, fell in love with the geographer's peculiarities. Paganel was far from being insensible to Miss Arabella's attractions, yet did not dare to declare his sentiments. The major accordingly undertook the part of Cupid's messenger between these two congenial hearts, and even told Paganel that marriage was \"the last blunder\" that he could commit. But the geographer was very much embarrassed, and, strangely enough, could not summon courage to speak for himself. [Illustration: Early in the afternoon the travelers reached Malcolm Castle, amidst the hurrahs of their tenantry and friends.] \"Does not Miss Arabella please you?\" MacNabb would say to him. \"Oh, major, she is charming!\" cried Paganel,--\"a thousand times too charming for me; and, if I must tell you, would please me better if she were less so. I should like to find a defect.\" \"Be easy,\" answered the major; \"she has more than one. The most perfect woman always has her share. Well, then, Paganel, are you decided?\" \"I do not dare.\" \"But, my learned friend, why do you hesitate?\" \"I am unworthy of her!\" was the geographer's invariable reply. At last, one day, driven desperate by the irrepressible major, Paganel confessed to him, under the pledge of secrecy, a peculiarity that would facilitate his identification, if the police should ever be on his track! \"Bah!\" exclaimed the major. \"It is as I tell you,\" persisted Paganel. \"What matter, my worthy",

      "text": " he was about reaching the long-desired harbor of Auckland, whence he would have returned to his native country. Yet, looking at his calm and passionless countenance, you could not have divined the depth of his anguish, for in his present critical situation he did not betray the extent of his misfortunes. He felt that he ought to set an example of fortitude to his wife and his companions, as being the husband and chief. Moreover, he was ready to die first for the common safety, if circumstances should require it. [Sidenote: CHIEFS, CIVILIZED AND UNCIVILIZED.] His companions were worthy of him; they shared his noble thoughts, and their calm and haughty appearance would scarcely have intimated that they were being carried away to captivity and suffering. By common consent, at Glenarvan's suggestion, they had resolved to feign a proud indifference in the presence of the savages. It was the only way of influencing those fierce natures. [Illustration: A boat might have been seen ascending the Waikato. It was a canoe seventy feet long and five broad.] Since leaving the encampment, the natives, taciturn like all savages, had scarcely spoken to each other. However, from a few words exchanged, Glenarvan perceived that they were acquainted with the English language. He therefore resolved to question the chief in regard to the fate that was in store for them. Addressing Kai-Koumou, he said, in a fearless tone: \"Where are you taking us, chief?\" Kai-Koumou gazed at him coldly without answering. \"Say, what do you expect to do with us?\" continued Glenarvan. The chief's eyes blazed with a sudden light, and in a stern voice he replied: \"To exchange you, if your friends will ransom you; to kill you, if they refuse.\" Glenarvan asked no more, but hope returned to his heart. Doubtless, some chiefs of the Maori tribe had fallen into the hands of the English, and the natives would attempt to recover them by way of exchange; their situation, therefore, was not one for despair. Meantime the canoe rapidly ascended the river. Paganel, whose changeable disposition carried him from one extreme to another, had regained his hopefulness. He believed that the Maoris were sparing them the fatigue of their journey to the English settlements, and that they were certain to arrive at their destination. He was, therefore, quite resigned to his lot, and traced on his map the course of the Waikato across the plains and valleys of the province. Lady Helena and Mary Grant, suppressing their terror, conversed in low tones with Glenarvan, and the most skillful physiognomist could not have detected on their faces the anxiety of their hearts. The Waikato River is worshiped by the natives, as Paganel knew, and English and German naturalists have never ascended beyond its junction with the Waipa. Whither did Kai-Koumou intend to take his captives? The geographer could not have guessed if the word \"Taupo,\" frequently repeated, had not attracted his attention. By consulting his map, he saw that this name was applied to a celebrated lake in the most mountainous part of the island, and that from it the Waikato flows. Paganel, addressing Captain Mangles in French, so as not to be understood by the savages, asked him how fast the canoe was going. The captain thought about three miles an hour. \"Then,\" replied the geographer, \"if we do not travel during the night, our voyage to the lake will last about four days.\" \"But whereabouts are the English garrisons?\" asked Glenarvan. \"It is difficult to say,\" replied Paganel. \"At all events, the war must have reached the province of Taranaki, and probably the troops are collected beyond the mountains, on the side of the lake where the habitations of the savages are concentrated.\" \"God grant it!\" said Lady Helena. Glenarvan cast a sorrowful glance at his young wife and Mary Grant, exposed to the mercy of these fierce natives, and captives in a wild country, far from all human assistance. But he saw that he was watched by Kai-Koumou, and, not wishing to show that one of the captives was his wife, he prudently kept his thoughts to himself, and gazed at the banks of the river with apparent indifference. [Sidenote: ACCESSIONS, AND PROGRESS.] The sun was just sinking below the horizon as the canoe ran upon a bank of pumice-stones, which the Waikato carries with it from its source in the volcanic mountains. Several trees grew here, as if designed to shelter an encampment. Kai-Koumou landed his prisoners. The men had their hands tied, the ladies were free. All were placed in the centre of the encampment, around which large fires formed an impassable barrier. Before Kai-Koumou had informed his captives of his intention to exchange them, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles had discussed various methods of recovering their liberty. What they could not venture in the boat they hoped to attempt on land, at the hour for encamping, under cover of the night. But since Glenarvan's conversation with the chief, it seemed wise to abandon this design. They must be patient. It was the most prudent plan. The exchange offered chances that neither an open attack nor a flight across these unknown regions could afford. Many circumstances might indeed arise that would delay, and even prevent, such a transaction; but still it was better to await the result. What, moreover, could ten defenceless men do against thirty well-armed savages? Besides, Glenarvan thought it likely that Kai-Koumou's tribe had lost some chief of high rank whom they were particularly anxious to recover; and he was not mistaken. The next day the canoe ascended the river with increased swiftness. It stopped for a moment at the junction of a small river which wound across the plains on the right bank. Here another canoe, with ten natives on board, joined Kai-Koumou. The warriors merely exchanged salutations, and then continued their course. The new-comers had recently fought against the English troops, as could be seen by their tattered garments, their gory weapons, and the wounds that still bled beneath their rags. They were gloomy and taciturn, and, with the indifference common to all savage races, paid no attention to the captives. Towards evening Kai-Koumou landed at the foot of the mountains, whose nearer ridges reached precipitously to the river-b",

No one expected to find the captain exactly on the line of the thirty-seventh parallel; but perhaps they would come upon traces of him, and, at all events, their course would bring them straight to the scene of the shipwreck, which was the principal point. Moreover, if Ayrton would consent to join the travelers, to guide them through the forests, and to the eastern coast, there was another chance of success. Glenarvan felt the importance of this arrangement, and was therefore particularly desirous of obtaining the services of Captain Grant's companion. He inquired of his host whether he was willing for him to propose to Ayrton to accompany them. Mr. O'Moore consented, though not without regret at losing so good an assistant. \"Well, Ayrton, will you aid us in our search for the sailors of the Britannia?\" The quartermaster did not answer immediately; he seemed to hesitate for a few moments, but finally, after reflecting, said: \"Yes, my lord, I will follow you; and, if I do not set you upon the track of Captain Grant, I will at least guide you to the place where his vessel was wrecked.\" \"Thanks,\" replied Glenarvan. \"One question, my lord.\" \"Ask it.\" \"Where will you join the Duncan?\" \"At Melbourne, if we do not cross Australia; on the eastern coast, if our search is continued so far.\" \"But the captain of the Duncan?\" \"He will await my orders at Melbourne.\" \"Very well, my lord,\" said Ayrton; \"rely on me.\" \"I will,\" replied Glenarvan. The quartermaster was heartily thanked by the travelers. Captain Grant's children lavished upon him their most grateful caresses. All were delighted at his decision, except the colonist, who would lose in him an intelligent and faithful assistant. But he understood the importance that Glenarvan attached to this new addition to his force, and was resigned. He had, moreover, engaged to furnish them with the means of conveyance for the journey, and, this business being settled, the party returned on board. [Illustration: This business being settled, the party returned on board.] Everything was now changed; all hesitation had vanished. These courageous searchers were no longer to wander on blindly. Harry Grant, they believed, had found a refuge on the continent, and each heart was full of the satisfaction that certainty brings when it takes the place of doubt. In two months, perhaps, the Duncan would land the lost captain on the shores of Scotland. When Captain Mangles seconded the proposal that they should attempt to cross Australia with the ladies, he supposed that this time he would accompany the expedition. He therefore consulted Glenarvan on the subject, and brought forward various arguments in his own favor, such as his desire to take part in the search for his countryman, and his usefulness in the undertaking. \"One question, John,\" said Glenarvan. \"You have absolute confidence in your mate?\" \"Absolute,\" replied he. \"Tom Austin is a good sailor. He will take the Duncan to Melbourne, repair her thoroughly, and bring her back at the appointed time. He is a man devoted to duty and discipline, and will never take the responsibility of changing or delaying the execution of an order. You can rely upon him as fully as on myself.\" \"Very well, captain,\" replied Glenarvan; \"you shall accompany us; for,\" added he, smiling, \"you certainly ought to be present when we find Mary Grant's father.\" \"Ah, my lord!\" murmured Captain Mangles, with something like a blush upon his swarthy cheeks. [Sidenote: A PALACE-CART.] The next day the captain, accompanied by the carpenter and by the sailors loaded with provisions, returned to the farm of Mr. O'Moore, who was to assist him in the preparations. All the family were waiting for him, ready to work under his orders. Ayrton was there, and freely gave them the benefit of his experience. He and his employer were agreed on this point, that the ladies ought to make the journey in an ox-cart, and the gentlemen on horseback. The colonist could procure them the animals and vehicle. The vehicle was a cart twenty feet long and covered with an awning, the whole resting upon four wheels, without spokes, felloes, or tires. The front wheels were a long way from the hind ones, and were joined together by a rude contrivance that made it impossible to turn short. To the body of the cart was attached a pole thirty-five feet long, to which three pairs of oxen were coupled. The animals, thus arranged, drew by means of a yoke across their necks, to which the bow was fastened with an iron pin. It required great skill to manage this long, narrow, tottering vehicle, and guide the oxen by means of the whip. But Ayrton had served his apprenticeship at O'Moore's farm, and his employer guaranteed his dexterity. Upon him, therefore, devolved the duty of driving. The cart, being without springs, was not very easy; but our travelers were obliged to conform to circumstances as much as they could. As no change was possible in its rude construction, Captain Mangles arranged the interior in the most comfortable manner. He divided it into two compartments by a wooden partition. The rear one was designed for the provisions, the baggage, and Mr. Olbinett's portable kitchen, while the forward one was reserved exclusively for the ladies. The carpenter converted it into a convenient chamber, covered it with a thick carpet, and furnished it with a dressing-table and two berths for Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Thick leathern curtains secured privacy, when necessary, and were a protection against the chilliness of the night. In rainy weather the men could find shelter under the awning; but a tent was to serve this purpose at the time of encampment. Captain Mangles succeeded in crowding into this narrow space all that two ladies could need, and Lady Helena and Mary Grant did not greatly miss the comfortable cabins of the Duncan. [Sidenote: A RETURN VISIT.] As for the men, seven strong horses were apportioned to Lord Glenarvan, Paganel, Robert Grant, Major MacNabb, Captain Mangles, and the two sailors, Wilson and Mulready, who accompanied this new expeditionary party. The horses and oxen grazed near at hand, and could be easily collected at the moment of departure. [Illustration: The vehicle was a",

      "text": " in an ill-humored way to the questions that were addressed him; but his answers sufficed to determine Ayrton upon his course. Glenarvan, however, remunerated the tavern-keeper for the little trouble they had given him, and was about to leave the inn, when a placard, affixed to the wall, attracted his attention. It was a notice of the colonial police, detailing the escape of the convicts from Perth, and setting a price upon the head of Ben Joyce--a hundred pounds sterling to any one who should deliver him up. \"Indeed,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is a rascal worth hanging.\" \"And especially worth taking,\" replied Ayrton. \"A hundred pounds! What a sum! He is not worth it.\" \"As for the inn-keeper,\" added Glenarvan, as he left the room, \"I scarcely put faith in him, despite his placard.\" \"Nor I either,\" said Ayrton. Glenarvan and the quartermaster rejoined the party, and they all proceeded to where a narrow pass wound across the chain. Here they began the ascent. [Sidenote: ANOTHER DEATH.] But it was an arduous task. More than once the ladies and their companions had to dismount, and it was often necessary to push the wheels of the heavy vehicle at some steep ascent, or to hold it back along the edge of some dangerous precipice. The oxen, as they could not work to advantage at sudden turns, had frequently to be unyoked, and the cart blocked to prevent it from sliding back. Ayrton was repeatedly forced to bring the already exhausted horses to his assistance. Whether this exertion was too prolonged, or whether from some other cause, one of the horses gave out during the ascent. He fell suddenly, without an instant's warning. It was Mulready's horse; and when the sailor attempted to help him up, he found that he was dead. Ayrton examined the animal carefully, but did not seem to understand the cause of this sudden death. \"The beast must have burst a blood-vessel,\" said Glenarvan. \"Evidently,\" replied Ayrton. \"Take my horse, Mulready,\" added Glenarvan; \"I will join Lady Helena in the cart.\" Mulready obeyed, and the little party continued their fatiguing ascent, abandoning the body to the crows. The next day they began the descent, which was much more rapid. During its course a violent hail-storm burst on them, and they were forced to seek a shelter beneath the rocks. Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds. A sling could not have hurled them with greater force, and several sharp blows warned Paganel and Robert to be on their guard. The cart was pierced through in many places: indeed, few roofs could have resisted the fall of these cutting missiles, some of which froze to the trunks of the trees. It was necessary to wait for the end of this avalanche, for fear of being stoned to death, and it was an hour before the party regained the steep path, still slippery with icy incrustations. At evening the cart, considerably shattered, but still firm on its wooden wheels, descended the last slopes of the Alps, between tall solitary pines, and reached the plains of Gippsland. [Illustration: Not hailstones, but pieces of ice as large as one's hand, were precipitated from the angry clouds.] [Sidenote: DIVIDED COUNSELS.] All were impatient to gain their destination, the Pacific Ocean, where the Britannia had been wrecked. There only could traces of the shipwrecked seamen be found, and not in these desert regions. Ayrton urged Lord Glenarvan to send an order to the Duncan to repair to the coast, that he might have at his disposal all the aid possible in his search. In his opinion they ought to take advantage of the Lucknow road, which would lead them to Melbourne. Afterwards this might be difficult, for highways leading directly to the capital would be absolutely wanting. This advice of the quartermaster seemed reasonable. Paganel seconded it. He thought, too, that the yacht would be very useful under the present circumstances, and added that they could no longer communicate with Melbourne after passing the Lucknow road. Glenarvan was undecided, and perhaps would have sent the order that Ayrton so particularly desired, if the major had not opposed this plan with great energy. He explained that Ayrton's presence was necessary to the expedition; that on approaching the coast the country would be unknown; that, if chance set them on the track of Captain Grant, the quartermaster would be more capable than any one else of following it; in short, that he alone could point out the place where the Britannia was lost. MacNabb, therefore, advocated their continuing on the journey without change. Captain Mangles was of the same opinion. The young captain observed that his lordship's orders could more easily reach the Duncan if sent from Twofold Bay, than by dispatching a messenger two hundred miles over a wild country. The major carried his point, and it was therefore decided that they should proceed to Twofold Bay. MacNabb noticed that Ayrton seemed quite disappointed, but he said nothing, and, according to his custom, kept his thoughts to himself. Early in the afternoon they passed through a curious forest of ferns. These arborescent plants, in full bloom, measured thirty feet in height. Horses and horsemen could easily pass beneath their drooping branches, and sometimes the rowel of a spur would ring, as it struck against their solid stalks. The coolness of the grove was very grateful to the wearied travelers. Paganel, always demonstrative, gave vent to exclamations of delight that startled flocks of parrots and cockatoos. All at once his companions saw the geographer reel in the saddle, and fall to the ground like a log. Was it giddiness, or sunstroke, caused by the heat? They hastened to him. \"Paganel! Paganel! what is the matter?\" cried Lord Glenarvan. \"The matter is, my dear friend,\" replied Paganel, extricating himself from the stirrups, \"that I no longer have a horse.\" \"What! your horse----?\" \"Is dead, stricken like Mulready's.\" At once Glenarvan, Captain Mangles, and Wilson examined the animal. Paganel was right. His horse had been suddenly stricken dead. \"This is singular,\" said the captain. \"Very singular indeed,\" muttered the major",
