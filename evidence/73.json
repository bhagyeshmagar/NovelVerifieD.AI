      "text": " what way do you read the document?\" [Illustration: The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.] \"Nothing is easier. Here is the document,\" said Paganel, producing the precious paper that he had studied so conscientiously for several days. A profound silence ensued, while the geographer, collecting his thoughts, took his time to answer. His finger followed the incomplete lines on the document, while, in a confident tone, he expressed himself in the following terms: \"'June 7th, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered after'--let us put, if you wish, 'two days, three days,' or, 'a long struggle,'--it matters little, it is quite unimportant,--'on the coast of Australia. Directing their course to shore, two sailors and Captain Grant endeavored to land,' or 'did land on the continent, where they will be,' or 'are prisoners of cruel natives. They cast this document,' and so forth. Is it clear?\" \"It is clear,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if the word _continent_ can be applied to Australia, which is only an island.\" \"Be assured, my dear Glenarvan, the best geographers are agreed in naming this island the Australian continent.\" \"Then I have but one thing to say, my friends,\" cried Glenarvan. \"To Australia, and may Heaven assist us!\" \"To Australia!\" repeated his companions, with one accord. \"Do you know, Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"that your presence on board the Duncan is a providential circumstance?\" \"Well,\" replied Paganel, \"let us suppose that I am an envoy of Providence, and say no more about it.\" [Sidenote: A FESTIVE BANQUET.] Thus ended this conversation, that in the future led to such great results. It completely changed the moral condition of the travelers. They had caught again the thread of the labyrinth in which they had thought themselves forever lost. A new hope arose on the ruins of their fallen projects. They could fearlessly leave behind them this American continent, and already all their thoughts flew away to the Australian land. On reaching the Duncan, they would not bring despair on board, and Lady Helena and Mary Grant would not have to lament the irrevocable loss of the captain. Thus they forgot the dangers of their situation in their new-found joy, and their only regret was that they could not start at once. It was now four o'clock in the afternoon, and they resolved to take supper at six. Paganel wished to celebrate this joyful day by a splendid banquet. As the bill of fare was very limited, he proposed to Robert that they should go hunting \"in the neighboring forest,\" at which idea the boy clapped his hands. They took Thalcave's powder-flask, cleaned the revolvers, loaded them with fine shot, and started. \"Do not go far,\" said the major, gravely, to the two huntsmen. After their departure Glenarvan and MacNabb went to consult the notches on the tree, while Wilson and Mulready revived the smouldering embers. Arriving at the surface of this immense lake, they saw no sign of abatement. The waters seemed to have attained their highest elevation; but the violence with which they rolled from south to north proved that the equilibrium of the Argentine rivers was not yet established. Before the liquid mass could lower, it must first become calm, like the sea when flood-tide ends and ebb begins. They could not, therefore, expect a subsidence of the waters so long as they flowed towards the north with such swiftness. While Glenarvan and the major were making these observations, reports resounded in the tree, accompanied by cries of joy almost as noisy. The clear treble of Robert contrasted sharply with the deep bass of Paganel, and the strife was which should be the most boyish. The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders. When the major and Glenarvan returned to the fire, they had to congratulate Wilson upon an excellent idea. The honest sailor had devoted himself to fishing with wonderful success, with the aid of a pin and a piece of string. Several dozen of little fish, delicate as smelts, called \"mojarras,\" wriggled in a fold of his poncho, and seemed likely to make an exquisite dish. At this moment the hunters descended from the top of the tree. Paganel carefully carried some black swallows' eggs and a string of sparrows, which he meant afterwards to serve up as larks. Robert had adroitly brought down several pairs of \"hilgueros,\"--little green-and-yellow birds, which are excellent eating, and very much in demand in the Montevideo market. The geographer, who knew many ways of preparing eggs, had to confine himself this time to cooking them in the hot ashes. However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered. The conversation was very animated. Paganel was greatly complimented in his twofold capacity of hunter and cook, and accepted these encomiums with the modesty that belongs to true merit. Then he gave himself up to singular observations on the magnificent tree that sheltered them with its foliage, and whose extent, as he declared, was immense. \"Robert and I,\" said he jokingly, \"imagined ourselves in the open forest during the hunt. One moment I thought we should be lost. I could not find my way. The sun was declining towards the horizon. I sought in vain to retrace my steps. Hunger made itself felt acutely. Already the gloomy coppices were resounding with the growls of ferocious beasts,--but no, there are no ferocious beasts, and I am sorry.\" \"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"you are sorry there are no ferocious beasts?\" \"Certainly.\" \"But, when you have everything to fear from their ferocity----\" \"Ferocity does not exist,--scientifically speaking,\" replied the geographer. [Illustration: However, the repast was as varied as it was delicate. The dried meat, the hard eggs, the broiled mojarras, and the roast sparrows and hilgueros, formed a repast which was long remembered.] \"Ha! this time, Paganel,\" said the major, \"you will not make me admit the utility of ferocious beasts. What are they good for?\" \"Major,\" cried Paganel, \"they are good to form classifications, orders, families, genera, sub-gener",

On the 26th of July, 1864, under a strong gale from the northeast, a magnificent yacht was steaming at full speed through the waves of the North Channel. The flag of England fluttered at her yard-arm, while at the top of the mainmast floated a blue pennon, bearing the initials E. G., worked in gold and surmounted by a ducal coronet. The yacht was called the Duncan, and belonged to Lord Glenarvan, one of the sixteen Scottish peers sitting in the House of Lords, and also a most distinguished member of the \"Royal Thames Yacht Club,\" so celebrated throughout the United Kingdom. Lord Edward Glenarvan was on board with his young wife, Lady Helena, and one of his cousins, Major MacNabb. The Duncan, newly constructed, had just been making a trial voyage several miles beyond the Frith of Clyde, and was now on her return to Glasgow. Already Arran Island was appearing on the horizon, when the look-out signaled an enormous fish that was sporting in the wake of the yacht. The captain, John Mangles, at once informed Lord Glenarvan of the fact, who mounted on deck with Major MacNabb, and asked the captain what he thought of the animal. \"Indeed, your lordship,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"I think it is a shark of large proportions.\" \"A shark in these regions!\" exclaimed Glenarvan. \"Without doubt,\" replied the captain. \"This fish belongs to a species of sharks that are found in all seas and latitudes. It is the 'balance-fish,' and, if I am not greatly mistaken, we shall have an encounter with one of these fellows. If your lordship consents, and it pleases Lady Helena to witness such a novel chase, we will soon see what we have to deal with.\" \"What do you think, MacNabb?\" said Lord Glenarvan to the major; \"are you of a mind to try the adventure?\" \"I am of whatever opinion pleases you,\" answered the major, calmly. \"Besides,\" continued Captain Mangles, \"we cannot too soon exterminate these terrible monsters. Let us improve the opportunity, and, if your lordship pleases, it shall be an exciting scene as well as a good action.\" \"Very well, captain,\" said Lord Glenarvan. He then summoned Lady Helena, who joined him on deck, tempted by the exciting sport. The sea was magnificent. You could easily follow along its surface the rapid motions of the fish, as it plunged and rose again with surprising agility. Captain Mangles gave his orders, and the sailors threw over the starboard ratling a stout rope, to which was fastened a hook baited with a thick piece of pork. [Sidenote: THE LAST MOUTHFUL.] The shark, although still at a distance of fifty yards, scented the bait offered to his voracity. He rapidly approached the yacht. You could see his fins, gray at their extremity and black at their base, beat the waves with violence, while his \"caudal appendage\" kept him in a rigorously straight line. As he advanced, his great glaring eyes seemed inflamed with eagerness, and his yawning jaws, when he turned, disclosed a quadruple row of teeth. His head was large, and shaped like a double-headed hammer. Captain Mangles was right. It was a very large specimen of the most rapacious family of sharks,--the \"balance fish\" of the English",

He accordingly consulted an old dervish, who told him that happiness was a very difficult thing to find in this world. 'However,' added he, 'I know an infallible way to procure you happiness.' 'What is it?' inquired the young prince. 'It is,' replied the dervish, 'to put on the shirt of a happy man.' Thereupon the prince embraced the old man, and set out in search of his talisman. He visited all the capitals of the earth; he tried the shirts of kings, emperors, princes, and nobles; but it was a useless task, he was no happier. Then he put on the shirts of artists, warriors, and merchants, but with no more success. He had thus traveled far, without finding happiness. At last, desperate from having tried so many shirts, he was returning very sadly one beautiful day to the palace of his father, when he spied in the field an honest laborer, who was joyously singing as he ploughed. 'Here is, at all events, a man who possesses happiness,' said he to himself, 'or happiness does not exist on earth.' He approached him. 'Good man,' said he, 'are you happy?' 'Yes,' replied the other. 'You wish for nothing?' 'No.' 'You would not change your lot for that of a king?' 'Never!' 'Well, sell me your shirt!' 'My shirt! I have none!'\" [Illustration: They were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage.] CHAPTER XXV. BETWEEN FIRE AND WATER. Jacques Paganel's story had a very great success. He was greatly applauded, but each retained his own opinion, and the geographer obtained the result common to most discussions,--of convincing nobody. However, they were agreed on this point, that it was necessary to have courage for every fortune, and be contented with a tree when one has neither palace nor cottage. During the course of this confabulation evening had come on. Only a good sleep could thoroughly refresh, after this eventful day. The inmates of the tree felt themselves not only fatigued by the sudden changes of the inundation, but especially overcome by the heat, which had been excessive. Their feathered companions had already set the example; the hilgueros, those nightingales of the Pampas, had ceased their melodious warblings, and all the birds had disappeared in the recesses of the foliage. The best plan was to imitate them. But before \"retiring to their nest,\" as Paganel said, Glenarvan, Robert, and he climbed to the observatory, to examine for the last time the watery expanse. It was about nine o'clock. The sun had just set in the sparkling mists of the horizon, and all the western part of the firmament was bathed in a warm vapor. The constellations, usually so dazzling, seemed veiled in a soft haze. Still they could be distinguished, and Paganel pointed out to Robert, for Glenarvan's benefit, that zone where the stars are most brilliant. [Sidenote: PHILOSOPHY AND PONCHOS.] While the geographer was discoursing thus, the whole eastern horizon assumed a stormy aspect. A dense and dark band, clearly defined, gradually rose, dimming the light of the stars. This cloud of threatening appearance soon invaded almost the entire vault of the sky. Its motive power must have been inherent in itself, for there was not a breath of wind. Not a leaf stirred on the tree, not a ripple curled the surface of the waters. Even the air seemed to fail, as if some huge pneumatic machine had rarefied it. A strong electric current was perceptible in the atmosphere, and every creature felt it course along the nerves. Glenarvan, Paganel, and Robert were sensibly affected by these electric currents. \"We shall have a storm,\" said Paganel. \"You are not afraid of thunder?\" asked Glenarvan of the boy. \"Oh, no, my lord,\" replied Robert. \"Well, so much the better; for the storm is now not far distant.\" \"And it will be violent,\" continued Paganel, \"so far as I can judge from the state of the sky.\" \"It is not the storm that troubles me,\" said Glenarvan, \"but the torrents of rain with which it will be accompanied. We shall be drenched to the skin again. Whatever you may say, Paganel, a nest cannot suffice a man, as you will soon learn to your cost.\" \"Oh, yes, it can, with philosophy,\" briskly replied the geographer. \"Philosophy does not prevent you from getting wet.\" \"No, but it warms you.\" \"Well, then,\" said Glenarvan, \"let us join our friends and persuade them to envelop us with their philosophy and their ponchos as closely as possible, and especially to lay in a stock of patience, for we shall need it.\" So saying, he gave another look at the threatening sky. The mass of clouds now covered it entirely. A faint line of light towards the horizon was scarcely discernible in the dimness. The sombre appearance of the water had increased, and between the dark mass below and the clouds above there was scarcely a separation. At the same time all perception seemed dulled; and a leaden torpor rested upon both eyes and ears, while the silence was profound. \"Let us go down,\" said Glenarvan; \"the lightning will soon be here.\" His two companions and himself slid down the smooth branches, and were somewhat surprised to find themselves in a remarkable kind of twilight, which was produced by myriads of luminous objects that crossed each other and buzzed on the surface of the water. \"Phosphorescences?\" said Glenarvan. \"No,\" replied Paganel, \"but phosphorescent insects, real glow-worms",

      "text": " Your people have invaded our island. They have stolen away our fields; they have burned our villages.\" \"They have done wrong,\" said Glenarvan, in a grave tone. \"I say so because I think so, and not because I am in your power.\" \"Listen,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Tohonga, the high-priest of Nouï-Atoua, has fallen into the hands of your brothers. He is prisoner of the Pakekas (Europeans). Our god commands us to ransom his life. I would have torn out your heart, I would have hung your companions' heads and yours forever to the stakes of this palisade. But Nouï-Atoua has spoken.\" So saying, Kai-Koumou, who had hitherto controlled himself, trembled with rage, and his countenance was flushed with a fierce exultation. Then, after a few moments, he resumed, more coolly: \"Do you think the English will give us our Tohonga in exchange for you?\" Glenarvan hesitated, and watched the Maori chief very attentively. \"I do not know,\" said he, after a moment's silence. \"Speak,\" continued Kai-Koumou. \"Is your life worth that of our Tohonga?\" \"No,\" answered Glenarvan. \"I am neither a chief nor a priest among my people.\" Paganel was astounded at this reply, and gazed at Glenarvan in profound wonder. Kai-Koumou seemed equally surprised. \"Then you doubt it?\" said he. \"I do not know,\" repeated Glenarvan. \"Will not your people accept you in exchange for our Tohonga?\" \"Not me alone,\" replied Glenarvan; \"but perhaps all of us.\" \"Among the Maoris,\" said Kai-Koumou, \"it is one for one.\" \"Offer these ladies first in exchange for your priest,\" answered Glenarvan, pointing to Lady Helena and Mary Grant. Lady Helena would have rushed towards her husband, but the major restrained her. \"These two ladies,\" continued Glenarvan, turning respectfully towards them, \"hold a high rank in their country.\" The warrior glanced coldly at his prisoner. A malicious smile passed over his face; but he almost instantly repressed it, and replied, in a voice which he could scarcely control: \"Do you hope, then, to deceive Kai-Koumou by false words, cursed European? Do you think that Kai-Koumou's eyes cannot read your heart?\" Then, pointing to Lady Helena, he said: \"That is your wife!\" \"No, mine!\" cried Kara-Tété. Then, pushing back the prisoners, the chief laid his hand on Lady Helena's shoulder, who grew pale at the touch. \"Edward!\" cried the unfortunate woman, in terror. Glenarvan, without uttering a word, raised his arm. A report resounded. Kara-Tété fell dead. At this sound a crowd of natives issued from the huts. The pah was filled in an instant. A hundred arms were raised against the captives. Glenarvan's revolver was snatched from his hand. Kai-Koumou cast a strange look at Glenarvan, and then, guarding with one hand the person of him who had fired, he controlled with the other the throng that was rushing upon the Europeans. [Illustration: At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he.] At last his voice rose above the tumult. \"Taboo! taboo!\" cried he. At this word the crowd fell back before Glenarvan and his companions, thus temporarily preserved by a supernatural power. A few moments after they were led back to the temple that served as their prison; but Robert Grant and Paganel were no longer with them. CHAPTER L. THE CHIEF'S FUNERAL. Kai-Koumou, according to a custom quite ordinary in New Zealand, joined the rank of priest to that of chief, and could, therefore, extend to persons or objects the superstitious protection of the taboo. The taboo, which is common to the tribes of Polynesia, has the power to prohibit at once all connection with the object or person tabooed. According to the Maori religion, whoever should lay his sacrilegious hand on what is declared taboo would be punished with death by the offended god; and in case the divinity should delay to avenge his own insult, the priests would not fail to excite his anger. As for the prisoners confined in the temple, the taboo had rescued them from the fury of the tribe. Some of the natives, the friends and partisans of Kai-Koumou, had stopped suddenly at the command of their chief, and had protected the captives. [Sidenote: THE TORTURES OF SUSPENSE.] Glenarvan, however, was not blind to the fate that was reserved for him. Only his death could atone for the murder of a chief. Among savage races death is always preceded by a protracted torture. He therefore expected to cruelly expiate the righteous indignation that had nerved his arm, but hoped that Kai-Koumou's rage would fall only on himself. What a night he and his companions passed! Who could depict their anguish, or measure their sufferings? Neither poor Robert nor brave Paganel had reappeared. But how could they doubt their fate? Were they not the first victims of the natives' vengeance? All hope had vanished even from the heart of the major, who did not easily despair. John Mangles felt himself growing mad at sight of the sad dejection of Mary Grant, thus separated from her brother. Glenarvan thought of that terrible request of Lady Helena, who, rather than yield to torture or slavery, preferred to die by his hand. Could he summon this fearful courage? As for an escape, that was plainly impossible. Ten warriors, armed to the teeth, guarded the entrance of the temple. Morning came at last. There had been no communication between the natives and the prisoners. The hut contained a considerable quantity of food, which the unfortunates scarcely touched. Hunger gave place to grief. The day passed without bringing a change or a hope. Doubtless the hour for the dead chief's funeral and their torture would be the same. However, although Glenarvan concluded that Kai-Koumou must have abandoned all idea of exchange, the major on this point retained a gleam of hope. \"Who knows,\" said he, reminding Glenarvan of the effect produced upon the chief by the death of Kara-Tété,--\"who knows but that Kai-Koumou in reality feels obliged to you?\" But, in spite of these observations, Glenar",

      "text": " I expect, or even fails, our situation will not be impaired. But it ought to and will succeed.\" \"And this project?\" asked the major. \"This is it,\" replied Paganel. \"The superstition of the natives has made this mountain a place of refuge, and this superstition must help us to escape. If I succeed in convincing Kai-Koumou that we have become the victims of our sacrilege, that the wrath of Heaven has fallen upon us, in short, that we have met a terrible death, do you think that he will abandon the mountain and return to his village?\" \"Probably,\" said Glenarvan. \"And with what horrible death do you threaten us?\" inquired Lady Helena. \"The death of the sacrilegious, my friends,\" continued Paganel. \"The avenging flames are under our feet. Let us open a way for them.\" \"What! you would make a volcano?\" cried Captain Mangles. \"Yes, a factitious, an improvised one, whose fury we will control. There is quite a supply of vapors and subterranean fires that only ask for an outlet. Let us arrange an artificial eruption for our own advantage.\" \"The idea is good,\" said the major, \"and well conceived, Paganel.\" \"You understand,\" resumed the geographer, \"that we are to feign being consumed by the flames of Pluto, and shall disappear spiritually in the tomb of Kara-Tété.\" [Sidenote: A VOLCANO IN MINIATURE.] \"Where we shall remain three, four, or five days, if necessary, till the savages are convinced of our death, and abandon the siege.\" \"But if they think of making sure of our destruction,\" said Miss Grant, \"and climb the mountain?\" \"No, my dear Mary,\" replied Paganel, \"they will not do that. The mountain is tabooed, and if it shall itself devour its profaners the taboo will be still more rigorous.\" \"This plan is really well conceived,\" remarked Glenarvan. \"There is only one chance against it, and that is, that the savages may persist in remaining at the foot of the mountain till the provisions fail us. But this is scarcely probable, especially if we play our part skillfully.\" \"And when shall we make this last venture?\" asked Lady Helena. \"This very evening,\" answered Paganel, \"at the hour of the greatest darkness.\" \"Agreed,\" said MacNabb. \"Paganel, you are a man of genius; and although from habit I am scarcely ever enthusiastic, I will answer for your success. Ha! these rascals! we shall perform a little miracle for them that will delay their conversion a good century. May the missionaries pardon us!\" Paganel's plan was therefore adopted, and really, with the superstitious notions of the Maoris, it might and ought to succeed. It only remained to execute it. The idea was good, but in practice difficult. Might not this volcano consume the audacious ones who should dig the crater? Could they control and direct this eruption when the vapors, flames, and lava should be let loose? Would it not engulf the entire peak in a flood of fire? They were tampering with those phenomena whose absolute control is reserved for forces higher than theirs. Paganel had foreseen these difficulties, but he expected to act prudently, and not to venture to extremes. An illusion was enough to deceive the Maoris, without the awful reality of a large eruption. How long that day seemed! Each one counted the interminable hours. Everything was prepared for flight. The provisions of the tomb had been divided, and made into convenient bundles. Several mats, and the fire-arms, which had been found in the tomb of the chief, formed light baggage. Of course these preparations were made within the palisaded inclosure and unknown to the savages. At six o'clock the steward served a farewell feast. Where and when they should eat in the valleys no one could foretell. Twilight came on. The sun disappeared behind a bank of dense clouds of threatening aspect. A few flashes illumined the horizon, and a distant peal of thunder rumbled along the vault of the sky. Paganel welcomed the storm that came to the aid of his design. At eight o'clock the summit of the mountain was hidden by a foreboding darkness, while the sky looked terribly black, as if for a background to the flaming outbreak that Paganel was about to inaugurate. The Maoris could no longer see their prisoners. The time for action had come. Rapidity was necessary, and Glenarvan, Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, the steward, and the two sailors at once set to work vigorously. The place for the crater was chosen thirty paces from Kara-Tété's tomb. It was important that this structure should be spared by the eruption, for otherwise the taboo would become ineffective. Paganel had observed an enormous block of stone, around which the vapors seemed to pour forth with considerable force. This rocky mass covered a small natural crater in the peak, and only by its weight prevented the escape of the subterranean flames. If they could succeed in overturning it, the smoke and lava would immediately issue through the unobstructed opening. [Sidenote: VULCANS AT WORK.] The fugitives made themselves levers out of the stakes of the tomb, and with these they vigorously attacked the ponderous mass. Under their united efforts the rock was not long in moving. They dug a sort of groove for it down the side of the mountain, that it might slide on an inclined plane. As their action increased, the trembling of the earth became more violent. Hollow rumblings and hissings sounded under the thin crust. But the bold experimenters, like real Vulcans, governing the underground fires, worked on in silence. Several cracks and a few gusts of hot smoke warned them that their position was becoming dangerous. But a final effort detached the block, which glided down the slope of the mountain and disappeared. The thin covering at once yielded. An incandescent column poured forth towards the sky with loud explosions, while streams of boiling water and lava rolled towards the encampment of the natives and the valleys below. The whole peak trembled, and you might almost have thought that it was disappearing in a general conflagration. Glenarvan and his companions had scarcely time to escape the shock of the eruption. They fled to the inclosure of the tomb, but not without receiving a few scalding drops of the water, which bubbled and exhaled a strong sulphureous odor.

Paganel already saw an ironical smile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save his reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical demonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said Thalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course from west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the waves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain solemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to his companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard of any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was accordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the seven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel, excited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting interrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove to anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the Patagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard the Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave man.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel: \"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- \"_Es mio padre!_\" \"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe \"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being the result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of summer. The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it was almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily discovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened together, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid the little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they rested for the night. [Illustration] CHAPTER XVII. A SERIOUS NECESSITY. They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians as a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and less frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of willows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of fresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves for the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and thus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka bounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage for the horses that followed. [Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians as a shelter during the storms.] Early in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were encountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened heaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as animals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them. Thus no one, not even Paganel, knew how to explain this chain of skeletons in a space comparatively circumscribed. He therefore questioned",

Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women, and children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins. Their first movement was one of flight; but a few words from Ayrton restored confidence, and they slowly approached the party of Europeans. The major jocularly insisted that Robert was correct in saying that he had seen a monkey; but Lady Helena declined to accept his views, and, getting out of the cart, made friendly advances to these degraded beings, who seemed to look upon her as a divinity. Reassured by her gentle manner, they surrounded the travelers, and began to cast wishful glances at the provisions which the cart contained. Glenarvan, at the request of his wife, distributed a quantity of food among the hungry group. [Illustration: Of these miserable beings there were about thirty, men, women, and children, dressed in ragged kangaroo-skins.] After this had been dispatched, our friends were favored by their new acquaintances with a sham fight, which lasted about ten minutes, the women urging on the combatants and pretending to mutilate those who fell in the fray. Suddenly the excited crowd dropped their arms, and a profound silence succeeded to the din of war. A flight of cockatoos had made its appearance in the neighboring trees; and the opportunity to display their proficiency in the use of the boomerang was at once improved by the Australians. The skill manifested in the construction and use of this instrument served Lady Helena as a strong argument against the monkey theory, though the major pretended that he was not yet convinced. [Illustration: A sham fight, which lasted about ten minutes, the women urging on the combatants and pretending to mutilate those who fell in the fray.] Lord Glenarvan was now about to give the order to advance, when a native came running up with the news that he had discovered half a dozen cassowaries. The chase that followed, with the ingenious disguise assumed by the hunter, and the marvelous fidelity with which he imitated the movements and cries of the bird, was witnessed with interest by the travelers. Lady Helena adduced the skill displayed as a still further argument against the major's theory; but the obstinate MacNabb declined to recede from his position, citing to his antagonist the statement of the negroes concerning the orang-outangs,--that they are negroes like themselves, only that they are too cunning to talk, for fear of being made to work. CHAPTER XXXVIII. WEALTH IN THE WILDERNESS. [Sidenote: A PIANO IN THE DESERT.] After a peaceful night, the travelers, at seven o'clock in the morning, resumed their journey eastward over the plains. Twice they crossed the tracks of squatters, leading towards the north; and then the different hoof-prints would have been confounded if Glenarvan's horse had not left upon the dust the Black Point mark, distinguishable by its three trefoils. Sometimes the plain was furrowed with winding creeks, bordered by box-wood, which took their source on the slopes of the Buffalo Range, a chain of mountains whose picturesque outlines stretched along the horizon, and which the party resolved to reach that evening. Ayrton urged on his oxen, and, after a journey of thirty-five miles, they reached the place. The tent was pitched beneath a great tree. Night had come, and supper was quickly dispatched; all thought more of sleeping than of eating, after the fatigues of the day. Paganel, to whom fell the first watch, did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better resist sleep. In spite of the absence of the moon, the night was almost bright with the splendor of the southern constellations; and the geographer amused himself in reading the great book of the firmament, which is always open. The silence of sleeping nature was broken only by the sound of the horses' chains as they rattled against their feet. Paganel was becoming fully absorbed in his astronomical meditations, and occupying himself more with the things of heaven than those of earth, when a distant sound startled him from his reverie. He listened attentively, and, to his great astonishment, thought he distinguished the tones of a piano. A few boldly-struck chords wafted to his ears their harmonious vibrations. He could not be mistaken. \"A piano in the desert!\" said he to himself. \"It cannot be!\" It was indeed very surprising, and Paganel began to think that some strange Australian bird was imitating the sound of the instrument. [Sidenote: A TWOFOLD SURPRISE.] But at that moment a voice, harmoniously pitched, was heard. The pianist was accompanied by a vocalist. The geographer listened incredulously, but in a few moments was forced to recognize the sublime air that struck upon his ear. It was \"_Il mio tesoro tanto_\" from Don Juan. [Illustration: Paganel did not lie down, but, rifle on shoulder, guarded the encampment, walking to and fro that he might the better resist sleep.] \"Parbleu!\" thought the geographer, \"however strange the Australian birds may be, or even though the parrots were the most musical in the world, they could not sing Mozart.\" He listened to the end of this grand inspiration of the master. The effect of this sweet melody, in the stillness of the starlit night, was indescribable. He remained a long time under the influences of its enchantment. At last the voice ceased, and all was silent. When Wilson came to relieve the geographer, he found him wrapt in a profound reverie. Paganel said nothing to the sailor, but, reserving his account of the incident for Glenarvan the next day, he crept into the tent. In the morning the whole party were awakened by unexpected bayings. Glenarvan at once arose. Two magnificent pointers were gamboling along the edge of a small wood; but at the approach of the travelers they disappeared among the trees, barking loudly. \"There must be a station in",

Much of the time was spent on deck, where the ladies' cabins were now located, Mary Grant especially training her hand, head, and heart in feeling, thought, and action. The geographer set to work on a composition entitled \"Travels of a Geographer on the Argentine Pampas;\" but many a blank page did he leave. Tho Scottish peer (when tired of examining for the thousandth time all that belonged to his yacht) could look at the books and documents which he had brought with him, intending to peruse them carefully. And as to the major he was never in company and never out of company; his cigar insured, nothing else was wanted. Ever and anon many miles of the ocean would be covered by masses of sea-weed; these different species of algæ would afford subject for research; specimens must be preserved, authorities must be consulted, and as one result at least all would become wiser. Then a discussion would ensue on some geographical problem, and maps that were not attainable were of course appealed to by each disputant, though the subject in question was often of very trivial moment. It was in the midst of a debate of this kind, during the evening, that a sailor cried out,-- \"Land ahead!\" \"In what direction?\" asked Paganel. \"To windward,\" replied the sailor. The landsmen's eyes were strained, but to no purpose. The geographer's telescope was brought into requisition, but with no avail. \"I do not see the land,\" said its owner. \"Look into the clouds,\" said the captain. \"Ah!\" replied Paganel, struck with the idea, and shortly with the reality also; for there was the barren mountain-top of Tristan d'Acunha. \"Then,\" said he, \"if I remember aright, we are eighty miles from it. Is not that the distance from which this mountain is visible?\" \"Exactly so,\" replied the captain. A few hours brought them much nearer to the group of high and steep rocks, and at sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly separated from all the rest of the rocky group, and reflecting the glory of the blue heavens and of the rising orb on the placid sea at its base. There are three islets in this group,--Tristan d'Acunha, Inaccessible, and Rossignol; but it was only at the first [Illustration: Our friends found a few voluntary exiles on the former island, who, by means of seal-fishing, eke out a scanty existence in this out-of-the-way spot.] [Illustration: Inasmuch as this was sufficient to cook fish, Paganel decided that it was not necessary for him to bathe here \"geographically.\"] of these that the Duncan called. Inquiry was made of the authorities (for these islets are governed by a British official from the Cape of Good Hope) if there were any tidings of the Britannia. But nothing was known of such a ship; they were told of the shipwrecks which had occurred, but there was nothing that afforded a clue to that which they sought. They spent some hours in examination of the fauna and flora, which were not very extensive. They saw and were seen by the sparse population that subsist here, and in the afternoon of the same day the yacht left the islands and islanders so rarely visited. Whilst the passengers had been thus engaged, Lord Glenarvan had allowed his crew to employ their time advantageously to themselves in capturing some of the seals which are so plentiful in these latitudes. A few hours of their united toil resulted in the death of a large number of seals who were \"caught napping,\" and in the stowing away, for the profit of the crew when they should reach the Australian market, several barrels of the oil obtained from their carcases. Still onward on the same parallel lay the course of the Duncan, towards the Isles of Amsterdam and St. Paul; and the same subjects of conversation, study, and speculation engaged them all, until, one morning, they espied the first mentioned island, far ahead; and as they drew nearer, a peak rose clearly before their vision which strongly reminded them of the Peak of Teneriffe they had beheld a few months before. [Sidenote: WARM SPRINGS AND WARM TALK.] The Isle of Amsterdam or St. Peter, and the Isle of St. Paul, have been visited by very few, and but little is known of them. The latter is uninhabited; but our friends found a few voluntary exiles on the former island, who, by means of seal-fishing, eke out a scanty existence in this out-of-the-way spot. Here again inquiry was made, but in vain, for any information of the Britannia, her voyage, or her shipwreck. Neither on the Isle of Amsterdam nor on that of St. Paul, which the whalers and seal-fishers sometimes visit, had there been any trace of the catastrophe. Desolate as these lonely islands appeared to our travelers, they still were not devoid of objects of interest. They were meagre enough in vegetation and in animal life; but there were warm springs which well repaid a visit. Captain Mangles found the temperature of their waters to be 166° Fahrenheit; and, inasmuch as this was sufficient to cook fish, Paganel decided that it was not necessary for him to bathe here \"geographically.\" When they resumed their course, though many miles were before them, there was a growing sense of anticipation; they were not to pause again until the \"Australian continent\" was reached; and more and more did the conversation and discussions tend towards this continent as their subject. On one occasion so certain was Paganel as to the ease with which they would be able to pursue their search, when they arrived, that he asserted that more than fifty geographers had already made the course clear for them. \"What! fifty, do you say?\" asked the major, with an air of doubt. \"Yes, MacNabb, decidedly,\" said the geographer, piqued at the hesitancy to believe him. \"Impossible!\" replied the major. \"Not at all; and if you doubt my veracity, I will cite their names.\" \"Ah!\" said the major, quietly, \"you clever people stick at nothing.\" \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\" \"Of course, Paganel, if you like,\" replied MacNabb, seeing that he could not now recede from his position without incurring the ridicule of the company.

The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs.\" \"Then you would not care to visit another country?\" \"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil.\" \"Ah! you have a mission?\" \"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra in the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that traveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on Indian geography.\" Paganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was carried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been as impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of Schaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment of silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which science would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your ignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing India.\" \"Give it up! And why?\" \"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\" \"How? Captain Burton----\" \"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles. \"But the Scotia?\" \"This vessel is not the Scotia.\" Paganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord Glenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose features expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain Mangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising his shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his eyes, he exclaimed,-- \"What a joke!\" But at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were inscribed these two words, thus: [Illustration] \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and, leaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin. When the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board, except the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated even to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take the train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake the vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was the height of absent-mindedness. [Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.] \"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques Paganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once published a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan. However, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers of France.\" [Illustration] \"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady Helena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\" \"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his errors. Suppose he were in a railroad car, would it stop for him?\" \"No; but he could get out at the first station,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first landing.\" At this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after convincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating those fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others in his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the yacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he returned to Lord Glenarvan. [Illustration] \"And this Duncan is going----?\" he asked. \"To America, Monsieur Paganel.\" \"And where especially?\" \"To Concepcion.\" \"To Chili! to Chili!\" cried the unfortunate geographer. \"And my mission to India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the Central Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the Society?\" [Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.] \"Come, monsieur,\" said Glenarvan, \"do not despair. Everything can be arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little consequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains of Thibet. We shall soon reach Madeira, and there you will find a vessel to take you back to Europe.\" \"I thank you, my lord, and must be resigned. But we can say this is an extraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And my cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\" \"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\" \"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a pleasure yacht.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord Glenarvan----\" \"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan. \"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible to your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a beautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers. These ladies have probably never visited it. Well, the man at the helm needs only to give a turn to the wheel, and the Duncan will go as easily to Calcutta as Concepcion.",
