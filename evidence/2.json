This unfortunate word led Lady Helena to inquire if the amiable Frenchman had occasionally shown his habitual failing. The major and Lord Glenarvan looked at each other with a smile. As for Paganel, he laughed heartily, and promised \"upon his honor\" not to commit a single blunder during the entire voyage. He then in a very comical way told the story of his mistake in the study of Spanish. \"After all,\" he added, in conclusion, \"misfortunes are sometimes beneficial, and I do not regret my error.\" \"And why, my worthy friend?\" asked the major. \"Because I not only know Spanish, but Portuguese also. I speak two languages instead of one.\" \"By my faith, I should not have thought of that,\" replied MacNabb. \"My compliments, Paganel, my sincere compliments!\" [Sidenote: TABLE-TALK IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC.] Paganel was applauded, but did not lose a single mouthful. He did not, however, notice one peculiarity observed by Glenarvan, and that was the young captain's attentions to his neighbor, Mary Grant. A slight sign from Lady Helena to her husband told him how matters stood. He gazed at the two young people with affectionate sympathy, and finally addressed the captain, but upon a different subject. \"How did you succeed with your voyage, captain?\" he inquired. \"Excellently,\" replied the captain; \"only I must inform your lordship that we did not return by way of the Strait of Magellan.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"you doubled Cape Horn, and I was not there!\" \"Hang yourself!\" said the major. \"Selfish fellow! you give me this advice in order that you may share my rope!\" retorted the geographer. \"Well, my dear Paganel,\" added Glenarvan, \"unless we are endowed with ubiquity, we cannot be everywhere. Since you crossed the Pampas, you could not at the same time double Cape Horn.\" \"Nevertheless, I am sorry,\" replied the geographer. Captain Mangles now told the story of his voyage, and was congratulated by Glenarvan, who, addressing Mary Grant, said,-- \"My dear young lady, I see that Captain John pays his homage to your noble qualities, and I am happy to find that you are not displeased with his ship.\" \"Oh, how could I be?\" replied Mary, gazing at Lady Helena, and perhaps also at the young captain. \"My sister loves you, Mr. Captain,\" cried Robert, \"and I do too.\" \"And I return your love, my dear boy,\" replied Captain Mangles, a little confused by Robert's words, which also brought a slight blush to the face of the young girl. Then, changing the conversation to a less embarrassing subject, the captain added,-- \"Since I have related the Duncan's voyage, will not your lordship give us a few particulars of your travels, and the exploits of our young hero?\" No recital could have been more agreeable to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, and Glenarvan hastened to satisfy their curiosity. He told, word for word, all about their journey from ocean to ocean. The passage of the Andes, the earthquake, Robert's disappearance, his capture by the condor, Thalcave's fortunate shot, the adventure with the wolves, the boy's devotion, the meeting with Sergeant Manuel, the inundation, their refuge in the tree, the lightning, the fire, the alligators, the water-spout, the night on the shores of the Atlantic, all these incidents, cheerful or serious, excited alternately the joy and terror of his hearers. Many a circumstance was related that brought Robert the caresses of his sister and Lady Helena. Never was boy more highly praised, or by more enthusiastic friends. \"Now, my friends,\" remarked Lord Glenarvan, when he had finished his recital, \"let us think of the present. Let us return to the subject of Captain Grant.\" When breakfast was over, the party repaired to Lady Helena's state-room, and, taking seats around a table loaded with maps and charts, resumed the conversation. Glenarvan explained that the shipwreck had not taken place on the shores either of the Pacific or the Atlantic, and that, consequently, the document had been wrongly interpreted so far as Patagonia was concerned; that Paganel, by a sudden inspiration, had discovered the mistake and proved that they had been following a false trail. The geographer was accordingly asked to explain the French document, which he did to the satisfaction of every one. When he had finished his demonstration, Glenarvan announced that the Duncan would immediately set sail for Australia. The major, however, before the order was given, asked permission to make a single remark. \"Speak, major,\" said Glenarvan. \"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them. I consider them rational, sagacious, and worthy of our whole attention. But I desire to submit them to a final examination, that their validity may be incontestable.\" [Illustration: \"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them.\"] No one knew what the prudent MacNabb meant, and his hearers listened with some anxiety. \"Go on, major,\" said Paganel: \"I am ready to answer all your questions.\" \"Nothing can be simpler,\" said the major. \"Five months ago, in the Frith of Clyde, when we studied the three documents, their interpretation seemed clear to us. No place but the western coast of Patagonia could, we thought, have been the scene of the shipwreck. We had not even the shadow of a doubt on the subject.\" \"Very true,\" added Glenarvan. \"Afterwards,\" resumed the major, \"when Paganel, in a moment of providential absent-mindedness, embarked on board our vessel, the documents were submitted to him, and he unhesitatingly sanctioned our search upon the American coast.\" \"You are right,\" observed the geographer. \"And, nevertheless, we are mistaken,\" said the major. \"Yes, we are mistaken,\" repeated Paganel; \"but to be mistaken is only to be human, while it is the part of a madman to persist in his error.\" \"Wait, Paganel,\" continued the major; \"do not get excited. I do not mean that our search ought to",

Their captain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence proceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at heart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly interested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well, that, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had perceived it. As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the southern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which he covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with Mr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major, who was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at dinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's chests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman resolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would facilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for philology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on arriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard incessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours he did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught him the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She cut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait of the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia were seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They sailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous telescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered without hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels bound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and seventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep water, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of water. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe and easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources that are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks of Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests. [Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves.] During the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory, the shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely thirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well rewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant beams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the continent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of Terra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between two magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous masses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart of immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow, were lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered six thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long twilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while the sky was studded with brilliant stars. In the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on her course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the shores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would beat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe, teal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins appeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect; these were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name will be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and the rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the Spaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here he founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold weakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared, and in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred unfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in existence. [Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.] The vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed in the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and birches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas tapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the obelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported droves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting, which could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled Cape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other side of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the height of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands of clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky. [Illustration: Port Famine.] Cape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn is only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed between Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile shores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets of this tortuous labyrinth. The Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious windings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks. Without lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories established on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened. The yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern shores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks of Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation Island. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and Jacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved like Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled before the breezes of the Pacific.

And opening his mouth widely in order to articulate better, he said, in his best Spanish,-- \"You--are--a--brave--man.\" The native listened, but did not answer. \"He does not understand,\" said the geographer. \"Perhaps you do not pronounce well,\" replied the major. \"Very true! Curse the pronunciation!\" And again Paganel began, but with no better success. \"I will change the expression,\" said he. And pronouncing with magisterial slowness, he uttered these words,-- \"A--Patagonian,--doubtless?\" The native remained mute as before. \"Answer!\" added Paganel. The Patagonian did not reply. \"Do--you--understand?\" cried Paganel, violently enough to damage his organs of speech. It was evident that the Indian did not understand, for he answered, but in Spanish,-- \"I do not understand.\" It was Paganel's turn now to be astonished, and he hastily put on his glasses, like one irritated. \"May I be hanged,\" said he, \"if I understand a word of this infernal jargon! It is certainly Araucanian.\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan; \"this man answered in Spanish.\" And, turning to the Patagonian, he repeated,-- \"Spanish?\" \"Yes,\" replied the native. Paganel's surprise became amazement. The major and Glenarvan looked at him quizzingly. \"Ah, my learned friend!\" said the major, while a half smile played about his lips, \"you have committed one of those blunders peculiar to you.\" \"What!\" cried the geographer, starting. \"Yes, it is plain that this Patagonian speaks Spanish.\" \"He?\" [Illustration: A man of lofty stature was standing, motionless, on one of the first ledges of the mountain. This individual had broad shoulders, and long hair tied with leathern thongs.] [Sidenote: A PENINSULAR BABEL.] \"Yes. By mistake you have learnt another language, while thinking that you studied----\" MacNabb did not finish. A loud \"Oh!\" from the geographer, accompanied by shrugs of the shoulders, cut him short. \"Major, you are going a little too far,\" said Paganel in a very dry tone. \"To be sure, since you do not understand.\" \"I do not understand because this native speaks so badly!\" answered the geographer, who began to be impatient. \"That is to say, he speaks badly, because you do not understand,\" returned the major, calmly. \"MacNabb,\" said Glenarvan, \"that is not a probable supposition. However abstracted our friend Paganel may be, we cannot suppose that his blunder was to learn one language for another.\" \"Now, my dear Edward, or rather you, my good Paganel, explain to me what the difficulty is.\" \"I will not explain,\" replied Paganel, \"I insist. Here is the book in which I practice daily the difficulties of the Spanish language! Examine it, major, and you will see whether I impose upon you.\" So saying, Paganel groped in his numerous pockets. After searching a few moments, he drew forth a volume in a very bad state, and presented it with an air of assurance. The major took the book, and looked at it. \"Well, what work is this?\" he asked. \"The Lusiad,\" replied Paganel; \"an admirable poem which----\" \"The Lusiad!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Yes, my friend, the Lusiad of the immortal Camoëns, nothing more or less.\" \"Camoëns!\" repeated Glenarvan; \"but, unfortunate friend, Camoëns was a Portuguese! It is Portuguese that you have been studying for six weeks.\" \"Camoëns! Lusiad! Portuguese!\" Paganel could say no more. His eyes wandered, while a peal of Homeric laughter rang in his ears. The Patagonian did not wink; he waited patiently for the explanation of this event, which was totally incomprehensible to him. \"Insensate! fool!\" cried Paganel, at last. \"What! is it so? Is it not a mere joke? Have I done this? It is the confusion of languages, as at Babel. My friends! my friends! to start for India and arrive at Chili! to learn Spanish and speak Portuguese! this is too much, and, if it continues, I shall some day throw myself out of the window instead of my cigar.\" To hear Paganel take his blunder thus, to see his comical actions, it was impossible to keep serious. Besides, he set the example himself. \"Laugh, my friends,\" said he, \"laugh with a will! you cannot laugh as much as I do at myself.\" And he uttered the most formidable peal of laughter that ever issued from the mouth of a geographer. \"But we are none the less without an interpreter,\" said the major. \"Oh, do not be troubled,\" replied Paganel. \"The Portuguese and Spanish resemble each other so much that I made a mistake. However, this very resemblance will soon enable me to rectify my error, and in a short time I will thank this worthy Patagonian in the language he speaks so well.\" Paganel was right, for he could soon exchange a few words with the native. He even learned that his name was Thalcave, a word which signifies in Araucanian \"the thunderer.\" This surname was doubtless given to him for his skill in the use of fire-arms. [Sidenote: BETTER PROSPECTS.] But Glenarvan was particularly rejoiced to discover that the Patagonian was a guide, and, moreover, a guide of the Pampas. There was, therefore, something so providential in this meeting that the success of the enterprise seemed already an accomplished fact, and no one any longer doubted the rescue of Captain Grant. In the meantime the travelers and the Patagonian had returned to Robert. The latter stretched his arms towards the native, who, without a word, placed his hand upon his head. He examined the child and felt his wounded limbs. Then, smiling, he went and gathered on the banks of the stream a few handfuls of wild celery, with which he rubbed the boy's body. Under this treatment, performed with an extreme gentleness, the child felt his strength revive, and it was plain that a few hours would suffice to restore him. It was therefore decided that that day and the following",

At one o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly subsided, and every one was able to enjoy an invigorating sleep. The next morning they rose bright and fresh, especially Paganel, who displayed great cheerfulness and animation. During this passage across the continent, Lord Glenarvan watched with scrupulous attention for the approach of the natives. He wished to question them concerning Captain Grant, by the aid of the Patagonian, with whom Paganel had begun to converse considerably. But they followed a path little frequented by the Indians, for the trails over the Pampas, which lead from the Argentine Republic to the Andes, are situated too far to the north. If by chance a wandering horseman appeared in the distance, he fled rapidly away, little caring to come in contact with strangers. However, although Glenarvan, in the interest of his search, regretted the absence of the Indians, an incident took place which singularly justified the interpretation of the document. Several times the course pursued by the expedition crossed paths on the Pampas, among others quite an important road--that from Carmen to Mendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses, sheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and lay bleaching in the sun. There were thousands of them, and, without doubt, more than one human skeleton had added its bones to those of these humbler animals. Hitherto Thalcave had made no remark concerning the line so rigorously followed. He understood, however, that if they kept no definite course over the Pampas, they would not come to cities or villages. Every morning they advanced towards the rising sun, without deviating from the straight line, and every evening the setting sun was behind them. In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been astonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they guided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve natural to the Indians he made no remark. But to-day arriving at the above-mentioned road, he stopped his horse, and turned towards Paganel. \"Road to Carmen,\" said he. \"Yes, my good Patagonian,\" replied the geographer, in his purest Spanish; \"road to Carmen and Mendoza.\" \"We do not take it?\" resumed Thalcave. \"No,\" answered Paganel. \"And we are going----?\" \"Always to the east.\" \"That is going nowhere.\" \"Who knows?\" Thalcave was silent, and gazed at the geographer with profound surprise. He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least in the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines that you are not speaking in earnest. \"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of silence. [Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.] \"No,\" replied Paganel. \"Nor to Mendoza?\" \"No.\" At this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said, and why he had stopped. When he had told him, Glenarvan said,-- \"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we must always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian understands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian, that he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently interrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to a half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to him. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated, articulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great drops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer move, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the sand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the two oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such embarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether he comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel ceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at the Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon the figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to Mendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses, sheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and lay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical smile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save his reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical demonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said Thalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course from west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the waves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain solemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to his companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard of any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was accordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the seven travelers, who",

The mildness of the climate justified this light costume. Each of these young soldiers carried a gun and a sword, which were too long and heavy for the little fellows. All had a certain family resemblance, and the corporal who commanded resembled them too: they were twelve brothers, who were parading under the orders of the thirteenth. [Sidenote: AN ARGENTINE COMMANDANT.] Paganel was not astonished. He remembered his Argentine statistics, and knew that in this country the average number of children in a family exceeds nine. But what surprised him exceedingly was to see these little soldiers practicing the French tactics, and to hear the orders of the corporal given in his own native language. \"This is singular,\" said he. But Glenarvan had not come to see boys drill, still less to occupy himself with their nationality or relationship. He did not, therefore, give Paganel time to express further astonishment, but besought him to ask for the commander of the fortress. Paganel did so, and one of the soldiers proceeded towards a small building which served as the barracks. A few moments after, the commander appeared in person. He was a man of fifty, robust, with a military air, thick whiskers, prominent cheek-bones, gray hair, and commanding look, so far as one could judge through the clouds of smoke that issued from his short pipe. Thalcave, addressing him, introduced Lord Glenarvan and his companions. While he spoke, the commander kept scrutinizing Paganel with quite embarrassing persistence. The geographer did not know what the trooper meant, and was about to ask him, when the latter unceremoniously seized his hand, and said, in a joyous tone, in his own language,-- \"A Frenchman?\" \"Yes, a Frenchman,\" replied Paganel. \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence. \"One of your friends?\" asked the major of Paganel. \"Yes,\" replied he, with national pride; \"we have friends in all parts of the world!\" [Illustration: \"Ah, I am delighted! Welcome, welcome! I am almost a Frenchman,\" cried the commander, shaking the geographer's arm with rather painful violence.] [Sidenote: RAISING A REGIMENT.] He then entered into conversation with the commander. Glenarvan would gladly have put in a word in regard to his affairs, but the soldier was telling his story, and was not in the mood to be interrupted. This honest man had left France a long time before; and the native language was no longer perfectly familiar to him: he had forgotten, if not words, at least the manner of combining them. As his visitors soon learned, he had been a sergeant in the French army. Since the foundation of the fort he had not left it, and commanded it by appointment from the Argentine government. He was by parentage a Basque, and his name was Manuel Ipharaguerre. A year after his arrival in the country, Sergeant Manuel was naturalized, joined the Argentine army, and married an honest Indian woman, who had twins,--boys, to be sure, for the sergeant's worthy consort would never present him with daughters. Manuel did not think of any other calling than that of the soldier, and hoped, in time, with the help of God, to offer to the republic a whole battalion of young soldiers. \"You have seen them?\" said he. \"Charming fellows! Good soldiers! José! Juan! Miguel! Pepe! Pepe is only seven years old, and is already biting his cartridge!\" Pepe, hearing himself complimented, joined his two little feet, and presented arms with perfect precision. \"He will do!\" added the sergeant. \"He will be a major--or brigadier-general one day!\" This story lasted a quarter of an hour, to Thalcave's great astonishment. The Indian could not understand how so many words could come from a single throat. No one interrupted the commander; and even a French sergeant had to conclude at last, though not without forcing his guests to accompany him to his dwelling. Here they were introduced to Madame Ipharaguerre, who appeared to be \"a good-looking person,\" if this expression may be employed in regard to an Indian. When he had exhausted himself, the sergeant asked his guests to what he owed the honor of their visit. And now it was their turn to explain. Paganel, opening the conversation in French, told him of their journey across the Pampas, and ended by asking why the Indians had abandoned the country. \"War!\" replied the sergeant. \"War?\" \"Yes, civil war.\" \"Civil war?\" rejoined Paganel. \"Yes, war between Paraguay and Buenos Ayres,\" answered the sergeant. \"Well?\" \"Why, all the Indians of the north are in the rear of General Flores, and those of the plains are plundering.\" \"But the caziques?\" \"The caziques with them.\" This answer was reported to Thalcave, who shook his head. Indeed, he either did not know, or had forgotten, that a civil war, which was afterwards to involve Brazil, was decimating two-thirds of the republic. The Indians had everything to gain in these internal struggles, and could not neglect such fine opportunities for plunder. The sergeant, therefore, was not mistaken in attributing this desertion of the Pampas to the civil war that was being waged in the northern part of the Argentine Provinces. But this event disconcerted Glenarvan's hopes. If Captain Grant was a prisoner of the caziques, he must have been carried by them to the northern frontiers. Yet how and where to find him? Must they attempt a perilous and almost useless search to the northern limits of the Pampas? It was a serious matter, which was to be earnestly considered. However, one important question was still to be asked of the sergeant, and the major thought of this, while his companions were looking at each other in silence. \"Have you heard of any Europeans being retained as prisoners by the caziques of the Pampas?\" Manuel reflected for a few moments, like a man who recalls events to recollection. \"Yes,\" said he, at length. \"Ah!\" cried Glenarvan, conceiving a new hope. [Sidenote: REVELATIONS.] Paganel, MacNabb, Robert, and he now surrounded the sergeant. \"Speak, speak!\" cried they, gazing at him with eagerness even in",

Was he alive, or dead?] \"What has got into you? Is this another of your eternal distractions?\" \"Yes, yes,\" replied Paganel, in a voice choked with emotion (and leaves). \"Yes, a distraction,--phenomenal this time.\" \"What is it?\" \"We have been mistaken! We are still mistaken!\" \"Explain yourself.\" \"Glenarvan, major, Robert, my friends,\" cried Paganel, \"all you who hear me, we are seeking Captain Grant where he is not.\" \"What do you say?\" cried Glenarvan. \"Not only where he is not,\" added Paganel, \"but even where he has never been.\" CHAPTER XXIV. PAGANEL'S DISCLOSURE. A profound astonishment greeted these unexpected words. What did the geographer mean? Had he lost his senses? He spoke, however, with such conviction that all eyes were turned towards Glenarvan. This declaration of Paganel was a direct answer to the question the former had asked. But Glenarvan confined himself to a negative gesture, indicating disbelief in the geographer, who, as soon as he was master of his emotion, resumed. \"Yes,\" said he, in a tone of conviction, \"yes, we have gone astray in our search, and have read in the document what is not written there.\" \"Explain yourself, Paganel,\" said the major; \"and more calmly.\" [Sidenote: A NEW IDEA.] \"That is very simple, major. Like you, I was in error; like you, I struck upon a false interpretation. When, but a moment ago, at the top of this tree, in answer to the question, at the word 'Australia' an idea flashed through my mind, and all was clear.\" \"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"do you pretend that Captain Grant----\" \"I pretend,\" replied Paganel, \"that the word _Austral_ in the document is not complete, as we have hitherto supposed, but the root of the word _Australia_.\" \"This is something singular,\" said the major. \"Singular!\" replied Glenarvan, shrugging his shoulders; \"it is simply impossible!\" \"Impossible,\" continued Paganel, \"is a word that we do not allow in France.\" \"What!\" added Glenarvan, in a tone of the greatest incredulity, \"do you pretend, with that document in your possession, that the shipwreck of the Britannia took place on the shores of Australia?\" \"I am sure of it!\" replied Paganel. \"By my faith, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"this is a pretension that astonishes me greatly, coming from the secretary of a geographical society.\" \"Why?\" inquired Paganel, touched in his sensitive point. \"Because, if you admit the word Australia, you admit at the same time that there are Indians in that country, a fact which has not yet been proved.\" Paganel was by no means surprised at this argument. He seemingly expected it, and began to smile. \"My dear Glenarvan,\" said he, \"do not be too hasty in your triumph. I am going to defeat you completely, as no Englishman has ever been defeated.\" \"I ask nothing better. Defeat me, Paganel.\" \"Listen, then. You say that the Indians mentioned in the document belong exclusively to Patagonia. The incomplete word _indi_ does not mean Indians, but natives (_indigènes_). Now do you admit that there are natives in Australia?\" It must be confessed that Glenarvan now gazed fixedly at Paganel. \"Bravo, Paganel!\" said the major. \"Do you admit my interpretation, my dear lord?\" \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if you can prove to me that the imperfect word _gonie_ does not relate to the country of the Patagonians.\" \"No,\" cried Paganel, \"it certainly does not mean Patagonia. Read anything you will but that.\" \"But what?\" \"_Cosmogonie! théogonie! agonie!_\" \"_Agonie!_\" cried the major. \"That is indifferent to me,\" replied Paganel; \"the word has no importance. I shall not even search for what it may signify. The principal point is that _Austral_ means Australia, and we must have been blindly following a false trail, not to have discovered before so evident a meaning. If I had found the document, if my judgment had not been set aside by your interpretation, I should never have understood it otherwise.\" This time cheers, congratulations, and compliments greeted Paganel's words. Austin, the sailors, the major, and Robert especially, were delighted to revive their hopes, and applauded the worthy geographer. Glenarvan, who had gradually been undeceived, was, as he said, almost ready to surrender. \"One last remark, my dear Paganel, and I have only to bow before your sagacity.\" \"Speak!\" \"How do you arrange these newly-interpreted words, and in what way do you read the document?\" [Illustration: The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.] \"Nothing is easier. Here is the document,\" said Paganel, producing the precious paper that he had studied so conscientiously for several days. A profound silence ensued, while the geographer, collecting his thoughts, took his time to answer. His finger followed the incomplete lines on the document, while, in a confident tone, he expressed himself in the following terms: \"'June 7th, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered after'--let us put, if you wish, 'two days, three days,' or, 'a long struggle,'--it matters little, it is quite unimportant,--'on the coast of Australia. Directing their course to shore, two sailors and Captain Grant endeavored to land,' or 'did land on the continent, where they will be,' or 'are prisoners of cruel natives. They cast this document,' and so forth. Is it clear?\" \"It is clear,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if the word _continent_ can be applied to Australia, which is only an island.\" \"Be assured, my dear Glenarvan, the best geographers are agreed in naming this island the Australian continent.\" \"Then I have but one thing to say, my friends,\" cried Glenarvan. \"To Australia, and may Heaven assist us!\" \"To Australia!\" repeated his",
