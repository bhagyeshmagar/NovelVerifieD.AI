      "text": " for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you.\" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs.\" \"Then you would not care to visit another country?\" \"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil.\" \"Ah! you have a mission?\" \"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra in the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that traveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on Indian geography.\" Paganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was carried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been as impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of Schaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment of silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which science would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your ignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing India.\" \"Give it up! And why?\" \"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\" \"How? Captain Burton----\" \"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles. \"But the Scotia?\" \"This vessel is not the Scotia.\" Paganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord Glenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose features expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain Mangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising his shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his eyes, he exclaimed,-- \"What a joke!\" But at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were inscribed these two words, thus: [Illustration] \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and, leaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin. When the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board, except the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated even to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take the train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake the vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was the height of absent-mindedness. [Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.] \"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques Paganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once published a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan. However, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers of France.\" [Illustration] \"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady Helena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\" \"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his errors. Suppose he were in a railroad car, would it stop for him?\" \"No; but he could get out at the first station,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first landing.\" At this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after convincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating those fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others in his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the yacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he returned to Lord Glenarvan. [Illustration] \"And this Duncan is going----?\" he asked. \"To America, Monsieur Paganel.\" \"And where especially?\" \"To Concepcion.\" \"To Chili! to Chili!\" cried the unfortunate geographer. \"And my mission to India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the Central Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the Society?\" [Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.] \"Come, monsieur,\" said Glenarvan, \"do not despair. Everything can be arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little consequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains of Thibet. We shall soon reach Madeira, and there you will find a vessel to take you back to Europe.\" \"I thank you, my lord, and must be resigned. But we can say this is an extraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And my cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\" \"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\" \"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a pleasure yacht.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord Glenarvan----\" \"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan. \"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible to your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a beautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers. These ladies have probably never visited it. Well, the man at the helm needs only to give a turn to the wheel, and the Duncan will go as easily to Calcutta as Concepcion.",

      "text": ", and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in search of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their captain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence proceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at heart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly interested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well, that, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had perceived it. As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the southern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which he covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with Mr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major, who was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at dinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's chests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman resolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would facilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for philology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on arriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard incessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours he did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught him the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She cut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait of the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia were seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They sailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous telescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered without hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels bound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and seventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep water, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of water. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe and easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources that are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks of Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests. [Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves.] During the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory, the shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely thirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well rewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant beams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the continent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of Terra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between two magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous masses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart of immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow, were lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered six thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long twilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while the sky was studded with brilliant stars. In the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on her course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the shores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would beat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe, teal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins appeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect; these were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name will be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and the rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the Spaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here he founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold weakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared, and in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred unfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in existence. [Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.] The vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed in the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and birches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas tapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the obelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported droves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting, which could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled Cape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other side of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the height of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands of clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky. [Illustration: Port Famine.] Cape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn is only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed between Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile shores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets of this tortuous labyrinth. The Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious windings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks. Without lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories established on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened. The yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern shores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks of Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation Island. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and Jacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved like Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled before the breezes of the Pacific.

After the death of Kara-Tété, Paganel had taken advantage, like Robert, of the confusion of the natives, and escaped from the pah. But less fortunate than young Grant, he had fallen upon an encampment of Maoris, who were commanded by a chief of fine form and intelligent appearance, who was evidently superior to all the warriors of his tribe. This chief spoke English accurately, and bade him welcome by rubbing his nose against that of the geographer. Paganel wondered whether he should consider himself a prisoner; but seeing that he could not take a step without being graciously accompanied by the chief, he soon knew how matters stood on this point. The chief, whose name was \"Hihy\" (sunbeam), was not a bad man. The spectacles and telescope gave him a high opinion of Paganel, whom he attached carefully to his person, not only by his benefits, but by strong flaxen ropes, especially at night. This novel situation lasted three long days. Was he well or badly treated? Both, as he stated without further explanation. In short, he was a prisoner, and, except for the prospect of immediate torture, his condition did not seem more enviable than that of his unfortunate friends. Fortunately, last night he succeeded in biting asunder his ropes and escaping. He had witnessed at a distance the burial of the chief, knew that he had been interred on the summit of Maunganamu mountain, and that it was tabooed in consequence. He therefore resolved to take refuge there, not wishing to leave the place where his companions were held captives. He succeeded in his undertaking, arrived at Kara-Tété's tomb, and waited in hope that Providence would in some way deliver his friends. Such was Paganel's story. Did he omit designedly any circumstance of his stay among the natives? More than once his embarrassment led them to suspect so. However that might be, he received unanimous congratulations; and as the past was now known, they returned to the present. Their situation was still exceedingly critical. The natives, if they did not venture to climb the mountain, expected that hunger and thirst would force their prisoners to surrender. It was only a matter of time, and the savages had great patience. Glenarvan did not disregard the difficulties of his position, but waited for the favorable issue which Providence seemed to promise. And first he wished to examine this improvised fortress; not to defend it, for an attack was not to be feared, but that he might find a way of escaping. The major and the captain, Robert, Paganel, and himself, took the exact bearings of the mountain. They observed the direction of the paths, their branches and declivities. A ridge a mile in length united the Maunganamu to the Wahiti range, and then declined to the plain. Its narrow and winding summit presented the only practicable route, in case escape should become possible. If the fugitives could pass this point unperceived, under cover of the night, perhaps they might succeed in reaching the deep valleys and outwitting the Maoris. But this course offered more than one danger, as they would have to pass below within gun-shot. The bullets of the natives on the lower ramparts of the pah might intercept them, and form a barrier that no one could safely cross. Glenarvan and his friends, as soon as they ventured on the dangerous part of the ridge, were saluted with a volley of shots; but only a few wads, borne by the wind, reached them. They were made of printed paper. Paganel picked them up out of curiosity, but it was difficult to decipher them. [Sidenote: A STRANGE COLPORTEUR.] \"Why!\" said he, \"do you know, my friends, what these creatures use for wads in their guns?\" \"No,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Leaves of the Bible! If this is the use they make of the sacred writings, I pity the missionaries. They will have difficulty in founding Maori libraries.\" \"And what passage of the Scriptures have these natives fired at us?\" asked Glenarvan. \"A mighty promise of God,\" replied Captain Mangles, who had also read the paper. \"It bids us hope in Him,\" added the young captain, with the unshaken conviction of his Scottish faith. \"Read, John,\" said Glenarvan. He read this line, which had so strangely reached them: \"Because he hath set his love upon Me, therefore will I deliver him:\" Psalm xci. I. \"My friends,\" said Glenarvan, \"we must make known the words of hope to our brave and dear ladies. Here is something to reanimate their hearts.\" Glenarvan and his companions ascended the steep paths of the peak, and proceeded towards the tomb, which they wished to examine. On the way they were astonished to feel, at short intervals, a certain trembling of the ground. It was not an irregular agitation, but that continued vibration which the sides of a boiler undergo when it is fully charged. Steam, in large quantities, generated by the action of subterranean fires, seemed to be working beneath the crust of the mountain. This peculiarity could not astonish people who had passed between the warm springs of the Waikato. They knew that this region of Ika-Na-Maoui is volcanic. It is like a sieve, from the holes of which ever issue the vapors of subterranean laboratories. Paganel, who had already observed this, called the attention of his friends to the circumstance. The Maunganamu is only one of those numerous cones that cover the central portion of the island. The least mechanical action could provoke the formation of a crater in the clayey soil. \"And yet,\" said Glenarvan, \"we seem to be in no more danger here than beside the boiler of the Duncan. This crust is firm.\" \"Certainly,\" replied the major; \"but a boiler, however strong it may be, will always burst at last after too long use.\" \"MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"I do not desire to remain on this peak. Let Heaven show me a way of escape, and I will leave it instantly.\" Lady Helena, who perceived Lord Glenarvan, now approached. \"My dear Edward,\" said she, \"you have considered our position! Are we to hope or fear?\" \"Hope, my dear Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"The natives will never come to the top of the mountain, and we shall have abundant time to form a plan of escape.\" \"Moreover, madam,\" said Captain Mangles,",

      "text": " He held in his hand the letter written by Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan. \"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor. Glenarvan took the letter, and read: \"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the eastern coast of New Zealand.\" \"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting. He snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes, adjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn. \"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter slipped from his fingers. Just then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found himself face to face with the major. [Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.] \"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is fortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\" This sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the whole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his hands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his frenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer. \"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your absent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the Duncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we should have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange association of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write New Zealand instead of Australia?\" \"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\" But at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he stopped short, finally replying: \"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible being, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\" The affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's presence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved, thought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a good breakfast. However, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and Robert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom Austin with them. They wished to question him further. \"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail for the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\" \"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I am not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could I act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your instructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done differently, captain?\" \"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles. \"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan. \"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was necessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of circumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that I was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover, on leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did not know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had disappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me very much.\" \"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned, the day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\" \"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles. \"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain. In an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his long-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready, their sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds, flashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality, the convict was in their power. \"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly. \"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\" \"Why this confinement?\" [Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.] \"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand, he flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the ship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged my men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was compelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come out.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the saloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took seats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on deck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate would be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain, if you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his intended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their places beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain Mangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered so severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did not yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a profound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his teeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing displayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord Glenarvan's presence, he folded his arms,",

Was he alive, or dead?] \"What has got into you? Is this another of your eternal distractions?\" \"Yes, yes,\" replied Paganel, in a voice choked with emotion (and leaves). \"Yes, a distraction,--phenomenal this time.\" \"What is it?\" \"We have been mistaken! We are still mistaken!\" \"Explain yourself.\" \"Glenarvan, major, Robert, my friends,\" cried Paganel, \"all you who hear me, we are seeking Captain Grant where he is not.\" \"What do you say?\" cried Glenarvan. \"Not only where he is not,\" added Paganel, \"but even where he has never been.\" CHAPTER XXIV. PAGANEL'S DISCLOSURE. A profound astonishment greeted these unexpected words. What did the geographer mean? Had he lost his senses? He spoke, however, with such conviction that all eyes were turned towards Glenarvan. This declaration of Paganel was a direct answer to the question the former had asked. But Glenarvan confined himself to a negative gesture, indicating disbelief in the geographer, who, as soon as he was master of his emotion, resumed. \"Yes,\" said he, in a tone of conviction, \"yes, we have gone astray in our search, and have read in the document what is not written there.\" \"Explain yourself, Paganel,\" said the major; \"and more calmly.\" [Sidenote: A NEW IDEA.] \"That is very simple, major. Like you, I was in error; like you, I struck upon a false interpretation. When, but a moment ago, at the top of this tree, in answer to the question, at the word 'Australia' an idea flashed through my mind, and all was clear.\" \"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"do you pretend that Captain Grant----\" \"I pretend,\" replied Paganel, \"that the word _Austral_ in the document is not complete, as we have hitherto supposed, but the root of the word _Australia_.\" \"This is something singular,\" said the major. \"Singular!\" replied Glenarvan, shrugging his shoulders; \"it is simply impossible!\" \"Impossible,\" continued Paganel, \"is a word that we do not allow in France.\" \"What!\" added Glenarvan, in a tone of the greatest incredulity, \"do you pretend, with that document in your possession, that the shipwreck of the Britannia took place on the shores of Australia?\" \"I am sure of it!\" replied Paganel. \"By my faith, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"this is a pretension that astonishes me greatly, coming from the secretary of a geographical society.\" \"Why?\" inquired Paganel, touched in his sensitive point. \"Because, if you admit the word Australia, you admit at the same time that there are Indians in that country, a fact which has not yet been proved.\" Paganel was by no means surprised at this argument. He seemingly expected it, and began to smile. \"My dear Glenarvan,\" said he, \"do not be too hasty in your triumph. I am going to defeat you completely, as no Englishman has ever been defeated.\" \"I ask nothing better. Defeat me, Paganel.\" \"Listen, then. You say that the Indians mentioned in the document belong exclusively to Patagonia. The incomplete word _indi_ does not mean Indians, but natives (_indigènes_). Now do you admit that there are natives in Australia?\" It must be confessed that Glenarvan now gazed fixedly at Paganel. \"Bravo, Paganel!\" said the major. \"Do you admit my interpretation, my dear lord?\" \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if you can prove to me that the imperfect word _gonie_ does not relate to the country of the Patagonians.\" \"No,\" cried Paganel, \"it certainly does not mean Patagonia. Read anything you will but that.\" \"But what?\" \"_Cosmogonie! théogonie! agonie!_\" \"_Agonie!_\" cried the major. \"That is indifferent to me,\" replied Paganel; \"the word has no importance. I shall not even search for what it may signify. The principal point is that _Austral_ means Australia, and we must have been blindly following a false trail, not to have discovered before so evident a meaning. If I had found the document, if my judgment had not been set aside by your interpretation, I should never have understood it otherwise.\" This time cheers, congratulations, and compliments greeted Paganel's words. Austin, the sailors, the major, and Robert especially, were delighted to revive their hopes, and applauded the worthy geographer. Glenarvan, who had gradually been undeceived, was, as he said, almost ready to surrender. \"One last remark, my dear Paganel, and I have only to bow before your sagacity.\" \"Speak!\" \"How do you arrange these newly-interpreted words, and in what way do you read the document?\" [Illustration: The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.] \"Nothing is easier. Here is the document,\" said Paganel, producing the precious paper that he had studied so conscientiously for several days. A profound silence ensued, while the geographer, collecting his thoughts, took his time to answer. His finger followed the incomplete lines on the document, while, in a confident tone, he expressed himself in the following terms: \"'June 7th, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered after'--let us put, if you wish, 'two days, three days,' or, 'a long struggle,'--it matters little, it is quite unimportant,--'on the coast of Australia. Directing their course to shore, two sailors and Captain Grant endeavored to land,' or 'did land on the continent, where they will be,' or 'are prisoners of cruel natives. They cast this document,' and so forth.
