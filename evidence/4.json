Was he alive, or dead?] \"What has got into you? Is this another of your eternal distractions?\" \"Yes, yes,\" replied Paganel, in a voice choked with emotion (and leaves). \"Yes, a distraction,--phenomenal this time.\" \"What is it?\" \"We have been mistaken! We are still mistaken!\" \"Explain yourself.\" \"Glenarvan, major, Robert, my friends,\" cried Paganel, \"all you who hear me, we are seeking Captain Grant where he is not.\" \"What do you say?\" cried Glenarvan. \"Not only where he is not,\" added Paganel, \"but even where he has never been.\" CHAPTER XXIV. PAGANEL'S DISCLOSURE. A profound astonishment greeted these unexpected words. What did the geographer mean? Had he lost his senses? He spoke, however, with such conviction that all eyes were turned towards Glenarvan. This declaration of Paganel was a direct answer to the question the former had asked. But Glenarvan confined himself to a negative gesture, indicating disbelief in the geographer, who, as soon as he was master of his emotion, resumed. \"Yes,\" said he, in a tone of conviction, \"yes, we have gone astray in our search, and have read in the document what is not written there.\" \"Explain yourself, Paganel,\" said the major; \"and more calmly.\" [Sidenote: A NEW IDEA.] \"That is very simple, major. Like you, I was in error; like you, I struck upon a false interpretation. When, but a moment ago, at the top of this tree, in answer to the question, at the word 'Australia' an idea flashed through my mind, and all was clear.\" \"What!\" cried Glenarvan, \"do you pretend that Captain Grant----\" \"I pretend,\" replied Paganel, \"that the word _Austral_ in the document is not complete, as we have hitherto supposed, but the root of the word _Australia_.\" \"This is something singular,\" said the major. \"Singular!\" replied Glenarvan, shrugging his shoulders; \"it is simply impossible!\" \"Impossible,\" continued Paganel, \"is a word that we do not allow in France.\" \"What!\" added Glenarvan, in a tone of the greatest incredulity, \"do you pretend, with that document in your possession, that the shipwreck of the Britannia took place on the shores of Australia?\" \"I am sure of it!\" replied Paganel. \"By my faith, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"this is a pretension that astonishes me greatly, coming from the secretary of a geographical society.\" \"Why?\" inquired Paganel, touched in his sensitive point. \"Because, if you admit the word Australia, you admit at the same time that there are Indians in that country, a fact which has not yet been proved.\" Paganel was by no means surprised at this argument. He seemingly expected it, and began to smile. \"My dear Glenarvan,\" said he, \"do not be too hasty in your triumph. I am going to defeat you completely, as no Englishman has ever been defeated.\" \"I ask nothing better. Defeat me, Paganel.\" \"Listen, then. You say that the Indians mentioned in the document belong exclusively to Patagonia. The incomplete word _indi_ does not mean Indians, but natives (_indigènes_). Now do you admit that there are natives in Australia?\" It must be confessed that Glenarvan now gazed fixedly at Paganel. \"Bravo, Paganel!\" said the major. \"Do you admit my interpretation, my dear lord?\" \"Yes,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if you can prove to me that the imperfect word _gonie_ does not relate to the country of the Patagonians.\" \"No,\" cried Paganel, \"it certainly does not mean Patagonia. Read anything you will but that.\" \"But what?\" \"_Cosmogonie! théogonie! agonie!_\" \"_Agonie!_\" cried the major. \"That is indifferent to me,\" replied Paganel; \"the word has no importance. I shall not even search for what it may signify. The principal point is that _Austral_ means Australia, and we must have been blindly following a false trail, not to have discovered before so evident a meaning. If I had found the document, if my judgment had not been set aside by your interpretation, I should never have understood it otherwise.\" This time cheers, congratulations, and compliments greeted Paganel's words. Austin, the sailors, the major, and Robert especially, were delighted to revive their hopes, and applauded the worthy geographer. Glenarvan, who had gradually been undeceived, was, as he said, almost ready to surrender. \"One last remark, my dear Paganel, and I have only to bow before your sagacity.\" \"Speak!\" \"How do you arrange these newly-interpreted words, and in what way do you read the document?\" [Illustration: The hunt promised well, and gave hopes of culinary wonders.] \"Nothing is easier. Here is the document,\" said Paganel, producing the precious paper that he had studied so conscientiously for several days. A profound silence ensued, while the geographer, collecting his thoughts, took his time to answer. His finger followed the incomplete lines on the document, while, in a confident tone, he expressed himself in the following terms: \"'June 7th, 1862, the brig Britannia, of Glasgow, foundered after'--let us put, if you wish, 'two days, three days,' or, 'a long struggle,'--it matters little, it is quite unimportant,--'on the coast of Australia. Directing their course to shore, two sailors and Captain Grant endeavored to land,' or 'did land on the continent, where they will be,' or 'are prisoners of cruel natives. They cast this document,' and so forth. Is it clear?\" \"It is clear,\" replied Glenarvan, \"if the word _continent_ can be applied to Australia, which is only an island.\" \"Be assured, my dear Glenarvan, the best geographers are agreed in naming this island the Australian continent.\" \"Then I have but one thing to say, my friends,\" cried Glenarvan. \"To Australia, and may Heaven assist us!\" \"To Australia!\" repeated his",

On one occasion so certain was Paganel as to the ease with which they would be able to pursue their search, when they arrived, that he asserted that more than fifty geographers had already made the course clear for them. \"What! fifty, do you say?\" asked the major, with an air of doubt. \"Yes, MacNabb, decidedly,\" said the geographer, piqued at the hesitancy to believe him. \"Impossible!\" replied the major. \"Not at all; and if you doubt my veracity, I will cite their names.\" \"Ah!\" said the major, quietly, \"you clever people stick at nothing.\" \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\" \"Of course, Paganel, if you like,\" replied MacNabb, seeing that he could not now recede from his position without incurring the ridicule of the company. [Illustration: \"Major,\" said Paganel, \"will you wager your rifle against my telescope that I cannot name at least fifty Australian explorers?\"] [Illustration: \"Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the learned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of the discovery of Australia.] \"Well, then,\" said Paganel to Lady Helena and Miss Grant, \"come and be umpires, and Master Robert shall count for us.\" And forthwith the learned geographer opened his budget, and poured forth the history of the discovery of Australia, with the names of its discoverers and the dates of their explorations, as fluently as though his sole calling in life was to be professor of Australian history. Rapidly he mentioned the first twenty who found or traversed the Austral shores; as rapidly did the names of the second score flow from his lips; and after the prescribed fifty had been enumerated, he kept on as though his list were inexhaustible. \"Enough, enough, Monsieur Paganel!\" said Lady Helena. \"You have shown that there is nothing, great or small, about Australia, of which you are ignorant.\" \"Nay, madam,\" said the geographer, with a bow. Then, with a peculiar expression, he smiled as he said to the major, \"We will talk about the rifle at another time.\" CHAPTER XXIX. THE STORM ON THE INDIAN OCEAN. Two days after this conversation, Captain Mangles took an observation, and the passengers saw, to their great satisfaction, upon consulting the map, that they were in the vicinity of Cape Bernouilli, which they might expect to reach in four days. The west wind had hitherto favored the progress of the yacht, but for several days it had shown a tendency to fail, and now there was a perfect calm. The sails flapped idly against the masts, and had it not been for her powerful screw, the Duncan would have been becalmed on the ocean. [Sidenote: FOREBODINGS OF DISASTER.] This state of things might be prolonged indefinitely. At evening Glenarvan consulted the captain on the subject. The latter, whose supply of coal was rapidly diminishing, appeared much disturbed at the subsidence of the wind. He had covered his ship with canvas, and set his studding- and main-sails, that he might take advantage of the least breeze; but, in nautical language, there was not enough wind \"to fill a hat.\" \"At all events,\" said Glenarvan, \"we need not complain. It is better to be without wind than to have a contrary one.\" \"Your lordship is right,\" replied Captain Mangles; \"but I dread some sudden change in the weather. We are now in the neighborhood of the trade-winds, which, from October to April, blow from the northeast, and our progress will, therefore, be very much retarded.\" \"But what can we do, captain? If this misfortune occurs, we must submit to it. It will only be a delay, after all.\" \"Probably, if a storm does not come upon us too.\" \"Do you fear bad weather?\" asked Glenarvan, looking at the sky, which, however, was cloudless. \"Yes,\" replied the captain. \"I tell your lordship, but would conceal my apprehensions from Lady Helena and Miss Grant.\" \"You act wisely. What do you apprehend?\" \"There are signs of a great storm. Do not trust the appearance of the sky, my lord; nothing is more deceptive. For two days the barometer has fallen to an alarming degree. This is a warning that I cannot disregard. I particularly fear the storms of the South Seas, for I have been already exposed to them.\" \"John,\" replied Glenarvan, \"the Duncan is a stout vessel, and her captain a skillful seaman. Let the storm come; we will take care of ourselves.\" Captain Mangles, while giving expression to his fears, was by no means forgetful of his duty as a sailor. The steady fall of the barometer caused him to take every measure of precaution. The sky, as yet, gave no indication of the approaching tempest; but the warnings of his infallible instrument were not to be disregarded. The young captain accordingly remained on deck all night. About eleven o'clock the sky grew threatening towards the south. All hands were immediately called on deck, to take in the sails. At midnight the wind freshened. The creaking of the masts, the rattling of the rigging, and the groaning of bulkheads informed the passengers of the state of affairs. Paganel, Glenarvan, the major, and Robert came on deck to render assistance if it should be needed. Over the sky, that they had left clear and studded with stars, now rolled thick clouds broken by light bands and spotted like the skin of a leopard. \"Has the storm broken upon us?\" asked Glenarvan. \"Not yet, but it will presently,\" replied the captain. At that moment he gave the order to reef the top-sail. The sailors sprang into the windward rattlings, and with difficulty accomplished their task. Captain Mangles wished to keep on as much sail as possible, to support the yacht and moderate her rolling. After these precautions had been taken, he told",

      "text": ", and every one had good hopes. On this voyage in search of Captain Grant, the probabilities increased every day. Their captain was one of the most confident on board; but his confidence proceeded especially from the desire that he cherished so strongly at heart, of seeing Miss Mary happy and consoled. He was particularly interested in this young girl; and this feeling he concealed so well, that, except Miss Grant and himself, no one on board the Duncan had perceived it. As for the learned geographer, he was probably the happiest man in the southern hemisphere. He passed his time in studying the maps with which he covered the cabin-table; and then followed daily discussions with Mr. Olbinett, so that he could scarcely set the table. But Paganel had all the passengers on his side except the major, who was very indifferent to geographical questions, especially at dinner-time. Having discovered a whole cargo of odd books in the mate's chests, and among them a number of Cervantes' works, the Frenchman resolved to learn Spanish, which nobody on board knew, and which would facilitate his search on the shores of Chili. Thanks to his love for philology, he did not despair of speaking this new tongue fluently on arriving at Concepcion. He therefore studied assiduously, and was heard incessantly muttering heterogeneous syllables. During his leisure hours he did not fail to give young Robert practical instruction, and taught him the history of the country they were rapidly approaching. In the meantime the Duncan was proceeding at a remarkable rate. She cut the Tropic of Capricorn, and her prow was headed toward the strait of the celebrated geographer. Now and then the low shores of Patagonia were seen, but like an almost invisible line on the horizon. They sailed along the coast for more than ten miles, but Paganel's famous telescope gave him only a vague idea of these American shores. The vessel soon found herself at the head of the strait, and entered without hesitation. This way is generally preferred by steam-vessels bound for the Pacific. Its exact length is three hundred and seventy-six miles. Ships of the greatest tonnage can always find deep water, even near its shores, an excellent bottom, and many springs of water. The rivers abound in fish, the forest in game, there are safe and easy landings at twenty places, and, in short, a thousand resources that are wanting in the Strait of Lemaire, and off the terrible rocks of Cape Horn, which are continually visited by storms and tempests. [Illustration: Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves.] During the first hours of the passage, till you reach Cape Gregory, the shores are low and sandy. The entire passage lasted scarcely thirty-six hours, and this moving panorama of the two shores well rewarded the pains the geographer took to admire it under the radiant beams of the southern sun. No inhabitant appeared on the shores of the continent; and only a few Fuegians wandered along the barren rocks of Terra del Fuego. At one moment the Duncan rounded the peninsula of Brunswick between two magnificent sights. Just here the strait cuts between stupendous masses of granite. The base of the mountains was hidden in the heart of immense forests, while their summits, whitened with eternal snow, were lost in the clouds. Towards the southeast Mount Taru towered six thousand five hundred feet aloft. Night came, preceded by a long twilight, the light melting away insensibly by gentle degrees, while the sky was studded with brilliant stars. In the midst of this partial obscurity, the yacht boldly continued on her course, without casting anchor in the safe bays with which the shores abound. Sometimes the tips of her yards would graze the branches of the beeches that hung over the waves. At others her propeller would beat the waters of the great rivers, starting geese, ducks, snipe, teal, and all the feathered tribes of the marshes. Soon deserted ruins appeared, and fallen monuments, to which the night lent a grand aspect; these were the mournful remains of an abandoned colony, whose name will be an eternal contradiction to the fertility of the coasts and the rich game of the forests. It was Port Famine, the place that the Spaniard Sarmiento colonized in 1581 with four hundred emigrants. Here he founded the city of San Felipe. But the extreme severity of the cold weakened the colony; famine devoured those whom the winter had spared, and in 1587 the explorer Cavendish found the last of these four hundred unfortunates dying of hunger amid the ruins of a city only six years in existence. [Sidenote: CHEERLESS MEMORIES.] The vessel coasted along these deserted shores. At daybreak she sailed in the midst of the narrow passes, between beeches, ash-trees, and birches, from the bosom of which emerged ivy-clad domes, cupolas tapestried with the hardy holly, and lofty spires, among which the obelisk of Buckland rose to a great height. Far out in the sea sported droves of seals and whales of great size, judging by their spouting, which could be seen at a distance of four miles. At last they doubled Cape Froward, still bristling with the ices of winter. On the other side of the strait, on Terra del Fuego, rose Mount Sarmiento to the height of six thousand feet, an enormous mass of rock broken by bands of clouds which formed as it were an aerial archipelago in the sky. [Illustration: Port Famine.] Cape Froward is the real end of the American continent, for Cape Horn is only a lone rock in the sea. Passing this point the strait narrowed between Brunswick Peninsula, and Desolation Island. Then to fertile shores succeeded a line of wild barren coast, cut by a thousand inlets of this tortuous labyrinth. The Duncan unerringly and unhesitatingly pursued its capricious windings, mingling her columns of smoke with the mists on the rocks. Without lessening her speed, she passed several Spanish factories established on these deserted shores. At Cape Tamar the strait widened. The yacht rounded the Narborough Islands, and approached the southern shores. At last, thirty-six hours after entering the strait, the rocks of Cape Pilares were discerned at the extreme point of Desolation Island. An immense open glittering sea extended before her prow, and Jacques Paganel, hailing it with an enthusiastic gesture, felt moved like Ferdinand Magellan himself, when the sails of the Trinidad swelled before the breezes of the Pacific.

At one o'clock in the morning the wind suddenly subsided, and every one was able to enjoy an invigorating sleep. The next morning they rose bright and fresh, especially Paganel, who displayed great cheerfulness and animation. During this passage across the continent, Lord Glenarvan watched with scrupulous attention for the approach of the natives. He wished to question them concerning Captain Grant, by the aid of the Patagonian, with whom Paganel had begun to converse considerably. But they followed a path little frequented by the Indians, for the trails over the Pampas, which lead from the Argentine Republic to the Andes, are situated too far to the north. If by chance a wandering horseman appeared in the distance, he fled rapidly away, little caring to come in contact with strangers. However, although Glenarvan, in the interest of his search, regretted the absence of the Indians, an incident took place which singularly justified the interpretation of the document. Several times the course pursued by the expedition crossed paths on the Pampas, among others quite an important road--that from Carmen to Mendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses, sheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and lay bleaching in the sun. There were thousands of them, and, without doubt, more than one human skeleton had added its bones to those of these humbler animals. Hitherto Thalcave had made no remark concerning the line so rigorously followed. He understood, however, that if they kept no definite course over the Pampas, they would not come to cities or villages. Every morning they advanced towards the rising sun, without deviating from the straight line, and every evening the setting sun was behind them. In his capacity of guide, Thalcave must, therefore, have been astonished to see that not only he did not guide them, but that they guided him. Nevertheless, if he was astonished, with the reserve natural to the Indians he made no remark. But to-day arriving at the above-mentioned road, he stopped his horse, and turned towards Paganel. \"Road to Carmen,\" said he. \"Yes, my good Patagonian,\" replied the geographer, in his purest Spanish; \"road to Carmen and Mendoza.\" \"We do not take it?\" resumed Thalcave. \"No,\" answered Paganel. \"And we are going----?\" \"Always to the east.\" \"That is going nowhere.\" \"Who knows?\" Thalcave was silent, and gazed at the geographer with profound surprise. He did not admit, however, that Paganel was joking the least in the world. An Indian, with his natural seriousness, never imagines that you are not speaking in earnest. \"You are not going to Carmen then?\" he added, after an instant of silence. [Sidenote: A PROFESSORIAL DIFFICULTY.] \"No,\" replied Paganel. \"Nor to Mendoza?\" \"No.\" At this moment Glenarvan, rejoining Paganel, asked what Thalcave said, and why he had stopped. When he had told him, Glenarvan said,-- \"Could you not explain to him the object of our expedition, and why we must always proceed toward the east?\" \"That would be very difficult,\" answered Paganel, \"for an Indian understands nothing of geography.\" \"But,\" said the major seriously, \"is it the history, or the historian, that he cannot understand?\" \"Ah, MacNabb,\" said Paganel, \"you still doubt my Spanish!\" \"Try, my worthy friend.\" \"Very well.\" Paganel turned to the Patagonian, and began a discourse, frequently interrupted for want of words and from the difficulty of explaining to a half-ignorant savage details which were rather incomprehensible to him. The geographer was just then a curious sight. He gesticulated, articulated, and exerted himself in a hundred ways, while great drops of sweat rolled down his face. When his tongue could no longer move, his arm came to his aid. He dismounted, and traced on the sand a geographical map, with lines of latitude and longitude, the two oceans, and the road to Carmen. Never was professor in such embarrassment. Thalcave watched these manoeuvres without showing whether he comprehended or not. The lesson in geography lasted more than half an hour. At last Paganel ceased, wiped his face, which was wet with perspiration, and looked at the Patagonian. \"Did he understand?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"We shall see,\" replied Paganel; \"but, if he did not, I give it up.\" [Sidenote: \"PERHAPS!\"] Thalcave did not stir. He no longer spoke. His eyes were fixed upon the figures traced on the sand, which the wind was gradually effacing. [Illustration: An important road--that from Carmen to Mendoza--distinguishable by the bones of such animals as mules, horses, sheep and oxen, whose remains were scattered by the birds of prey, and lay bleaching in the sun.] \"Well?\" asked Paganel. Thalcave did not appear to hear him. Paganel already saw an ironical smile forming upon the lips of the major, and, wishing to save his reputation, had begun with renewed energy his geographical demonstrations, when the Patagonian stopped him with a gesture. \"You are searching for a prisoner?\" he said. \"Yes,\" replied Paganel. \"And exactly on the line from the setting to the rising sun?\" said Thalcave, indicating by a comparison, in the Indian manner, the course from west to east. \"Yes, yes, that is it!\" \"And it is your God,\" said the Patagonian, \"who has confided to the waves of the vast ocean the secrets of the prisoner?\" \"God himself.\" \"May his will be accomplished then!\" replied Thalcave, with a certain solemnity. \"We will go to the east, and, if necessary, even to the sun.\" Paganel, in his exultation over his pupil, immediately translated to his companions the replies of the Indian. Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard of any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was accordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the seven travelers, who",

Glenarvan requested Paganel to ask the Patagonian if he had heard of any strangers falling into the hands of the Indians, which was accordingly done. \"Perhaps,\" replied the Patagonian. As soon as this word was translated, Thalcave was surrounded by the seven travelers, who gazed at him with questioning looks. Paganel, excited and scarcely finding his words, resumed these interesting interrogatories, while his eyes, fixed upon the grave Indian, strove to anticipate his reply before it issued from his lips. Every word the Patagonian said he repeated in English, so that his companions heard the Indian speak, as it were, in their own language. \"And this prisoner?\" inquired Paganel. \"He was a stranger,\" replied Thalcave slowly; \"a European.\" \"You have seen him?\" \"No, but he is mentioned in the accounts of the Indians. He was a brave man.\" \"You understand, my friends,\" said Paganel; \"a courageous man!\" \"My father!\" cried Robert Grant. Then, addressing Paganel: \"How do you say 'It is my father,' in Spanish?\" he asked. \"_Es mio padre_,\" answered the geographer. Immediately Robert, taking Thalcave's hands, said in a sweet voice,-- \"_Es mio padre!_\" \"_Suo padre!_\" replied the Patagonian, whose look brightened. He took the boy in his arms, lifted him from his horse, and gazed at him with the most curious sympathy. His intelligent countenance became suffused with a peaceful emotion. But Paganel had not finished his inquiries. Where was this prisoner? What was he doing? When had Thalcave heard of him? All these questions thronged his mind at once. He did not have to wait long for answers, but learnt that the European was a slave of one of the Indian tribes that scour the plains. \"But where was he last?\" asked Paganel. \"With the cazique Calfoucoura,\" answered Thalcave. \"On the line we have been following?\" \"Yes.\" \"And who is this cazique?\" \"The chief of the Poyuches Indians; a man with two tongues and two hearts.\" [Sidenote: A SCIENTIFIC BATH.] \"That is to say, false in word and in deed,\" said Paganel, after translating to his companions this beautiful metaphor of the Indian language. \"And can we rescue our friend?\" he added. \"Perhaps so, if your friend is still in the hands of the Indians.\" \"And when did you hear of him?\" \"A long time ago, and, since then, the sun has brought back two summers to the sky.\" Glenarvan's joy could not be described. This answer coincided exactly with the date of the document. But one question remained to be asked. \"You speak of a prisoner,\" said Paganel; \"but were there not three?\" \"I do not know,\" replied Thalcave. \"And you know nothing of their actual situation?\" \"Nothing.\" This last word ended the conversation. It was possible that the three prisoners had been separated a long time. But the substance of the Patagonian's information was that the Indians spoke of a European who had fallen into their power. The date of his captivity, the place where he must have been, everything, even to the Patagonian phrase used to express his courage, related evidently to Captain Harry Grant. Their progress was now somewhat slow and difficult; their next object being to reach and cross the river Colorado, to which at length their horses brought them. Here Paganel's first care was to bathe \"geographically\" in its waters, which are colored by a reddish clay. He was surprised to find the depth so great as it really was, this being the result of the snow having melted rapidly under the first heat of summer. The width likewise of this stream was so considerable that it was almost impossible for their horses to swim across; but they happily discovered a sort of weir-bridge, of wattles looped and fastened together, which the Indians were in the habit of using; and by its aid the little troop was enabled to pass over to the left bank, where they rested for the night. [Illustration] CHAPTER XVII. A SERIOUS NECESSITY. They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians as a shelter during the storms. At certain distances, but less and less frequent, pools of shallow water contributed to the growth of willows and a certain plant which is found in the neighborhood of fresh water. Here the horses drank their fill, to fortify themselves for the journey. Thalcave, who rode in advance, beat the bushes, and thus frightened away the \"cholinas\" (vipers), while the agile Thaouka bounded over all obstacles, and aided his master in clearing a passage for the horses that followed. [Illustration: They set out at daybreak. The horses advanced at a brisk pace among the tufts of \"paja-brava,\" a kind of grass that serves the Indians as a shelter during the storms.] Early in the afternoon, the first traces of animals were encountered--the bones of an innumerable drove of cattle, in whitened heaps. These fragments did not extend in a winding line, such as animals exhausted and falling one by one would leave behind them.

      "text": " for the first days of the voyage, I retired immediately, and have conscientiously slept thirty-six hours, I assure you.\" Jacques Paganel's hearers now knew the reason of his presence on board. The Frenchman, mistaking the vessel, had embarked while the crew of the Duncan were engaged in the ceremony at Saint Mungo. Everything was explained. But what would the geographer say, when he learned the name and destination of the vessel on which he had taken passage? \"So, Monsieur Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"you have chosen Calcutta as your centre of action?\" \"Yes, my lord. To see India is an idea that I have cherished all my life. It is my brightest dream, which shall be realized at last in the country of the elephants and the Thugs.\" \"Then you would not care to visit another country?\" \"No, my lord; it would be even disagreeable, for I have letters from Lord Somerset to the governor-general of India, and a mission from the Geographical Society which I must fulfil.\" \"Ah! you have a mission?\" \"Yes, a useful and curious voyage to undertake, the programme of which has been arranged by my scientific friend and colleague, M. Vivien de Saint Martin. It is to follow in the steps of the brothers Schlagintweit, and many other celebrated travelers. I hope to succeed where Missionary Krick unfortunately failed in 1846. In a word, I wish to discover the course of the Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo, which waters Thibet, and finally to settle whether this river does not join the Brahmapootra in the northeast part of Assam. A gold medal is promised to that traveler who shall succeed in supplying this much-needed information on Indian geography.\" Paganel was grandiloquent. He spoke with a lofty animation, and was carried away in the rapid flight of imagination. It would have been as impossible to check him as to stay the Rhine at the Falls of Schaffhausen. \"Monsieur Jacques Paganel,\" said Lord Glenarvan, after a moment of silence, \"that is certainly a fine voyage, and one for which science would be very grateful; but I will not further prolong your ignorance. For the present, you must give up the pleasure of seeing India.\" \"Give it up! And why?\" \"Because you are turning your back upon the Indian peninsula.\" \"How? Captain Burton----\" \"I am not Captain Burton,\" replied John Mangles. \"But the Scotia?\" \"This vessel is not the Scotia.\" Paganel's amazement cannot be depicted. He looked first at Lord Glenarvan, always serious; then at Lady Helena and Miss Grant, whose features expressed a sympathetic disappointment; and finally at Captain Mangles, who was smiling, and the imperturbable major. Then, raising his shoulders and drawing down his glasses from his forehead to his eyes, he exclaimed,-- \"What a joke!\" But at that his eyes fell upon the steering wheel, on which were inscribed these two words, thus: [Illustration] \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" he cried in a tone of real despair; and, leaping down the companion-way, he rushed to his cabin. When the unfortunate geographer had disappeared, no one on board, except the major, could retain gravity, and the laugh was communicated even to the sailors. To mistake the railroad was not so bad; to take the train to Dumbarton, instead of Edinburgh, would do. But to mistake the vessel, and be sailing to Chili, when he wished to go to India, was the height of absent-mindedness. [Sidenote: ABSENT-MINDEDNESS.] \"On the whole, I am not astonished at this on the part of Jacques Paganel,\" said Glenarvan; \"he is noted for such blunders. He once published a celebrated map of America, in which he located Japan. However, he is a distinguished scholar, and one of the best geographers of France.\" [Illustration] \"But what are we going to do with the poor gentleman?\" asked Lady Helena. \"We cannot take him to Patagonia.\" \"Why not?\" replied MacNabb gravely. \"We are not responsible for his errors. Suppose he were in a railroad car, would it stop for him?\" \"No; but he could get out at the first station,\" answered Lady Helena. \"Well,\" said Glenarvan, \"he can do so now, if he pleases, at our first landing.\" At this moment Paganel, woeful and humble, reappeared on deck, after convincing himself that his baggage was on board. He kept repeating those fatal words: \"The Duncan! the Duncan!\" He could find no others in his vocabulary. He went to and fro, examining the rigging of the yacht, and questioning the mute horizon of the open sea. At last he returned to Lord Glenarvan. [Illustration] \"And this Duncan is going----?\" he asked. \"To America, Monsieur Paganel.\" \"And where especially?\" \"To Concepcion.\" \"To Chili! to Chili!\" cried the unfortunate geographer. \"And my mission to India! But what will M. de Quatrefages say, the President of the Central Commission? How shall I represent myself at the sessions of the Society?\" [Sidenote: COURTESY AND CONVERSE.] \"Come, monsieur,\" said Glenarvan, \"do not despair. Everything can be arranged, and you will only have to submit to a delay of little consequence. The Yaroo-tsang-bo-tsoo will wait for you in the mountains of Thibet. We shall soon reach Madeira, and there you will find a vessel to take you back to Europe.\" \"I thank you, my lord, and must be resigned. But we can say this is an extraordinary adventure, which would not have happened but for me. And my cabin which is engaged on board the Scotia?\" \"Oh, as for the Scotia, I advise you to give her up for the present.\" \"But,\" said Paganel after examining the vessel again, \"the Duncan is a pleasure yacht.\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied Captain Mangles, \"and belongs to his lordship, Lord Glenarvan----\" \"Who begs you to make free use of his hospitality,\" said Glenarvan. \"A thousand thanks, my lord,\" replied Paganel; \"I am truly sensible to your courtesy. But permit me to make a simple remark. India is a beautiful country. It offers marvelous surprises to travelers. These ladies have probably never visited it. Well, the man at the helm needs only to give a turn to the wheel, and the Duncan will go as easily to Calcutta as Concepcion.",

      "text": ", that their validity may be incontestable.\" [Illustration: \"My object,\" said MacNabb, \"is not to invalidate the arguments of my friend Paganel, still less to refute them.\"] No one knew what the prudent MacNabb meant, and his hearers listened with some anxiety. \"Go on, major,\" said Paganel: \"I am ready to answer all your questions.\" \"Nothing can be simpler,\" said the major. \"Five months ago, in the Frith of Clyde, when we studied the three documents, their interpretation seemed clear to us. No place but the western coast of Patagonia could, we thought, have been the scene of the shipwreck. We had not even the shadow of a doubt on the subject.\" \"Very true,\" added Glenarvan. \"Afterwards,\" resumed the major, \"when Paganel, in a moment of providential absent-mindedness, embarked on board our vessel, the documents were submitted to him, and he unhesitatingly sanctioned our search upon the American coast.\" \"You are right,\" observed the geographer. \"And, nevertheless, we are mistaken,\" said the major. \"Yes, we are mistaken,\" repeated Paganel; \"but to be mistaken is only to be human, while it is the part of a madman to persist in his error.\" \"Wait, Paganel,\" continued the major; \"do not get excited. I do not mean that our search ought to be prolonged in America.\" \"What do you ask, then?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"Simply the acknowledgment that Australia now seems to be the scene of the Britannia's shipwreck as much as South America did before.\" \"Granted,\" replied Paganel. \"Who knows, then,\" resumed the major, \"whether, after Australia, another country may not offer us the same probabilities, and whether, when this new search proves vain, it may not seem evident that we ought to have searched elsewhere?\" [Sidenote: FRIENDS IN COUNCIL.] Glenarvan and Paganel glanced at each other. The major's remarks were strictly correct. \"I desire, therefore,\" added MacNabb, \"that a final test be made before we start for Australia. Here are the documents and maps. Let us examine successively all points that the thirty-seventh parallel crosses, and see if there is not some other country to which the document has as precise a reference.\" \"Nothing is easier,\" replied Paganel. The map was placed before Lady Helena, and all showed themselves ready to follow Paganel's demonstration. After carefully examining the documents, it was unanimously agreed that Paganel's interpretation was the correct one. \"I leave you, therefore, my friends,\" said he, in conclusion, \"to decide whether all the probabilities are not in favor of the Australian continent.\" \"Evidently,\" replied the passengers and the captain with unanimity. \"Captain,\" said Glenarvan, \"have you sufficient provisions and coal?\" \"Yes, my lord, I procured ample supplies at Talcahuana, and, besides, we can lay in a fresh stock of fuel at Cape Town.\" \"One more remark,\" said the major. \"A thousand, if you please!\" \"Whatever may be the guarantees for success in Australia, will it not be well to call for a day or two, in passing, at the islets of Tristan d'Acunha and Amsterdam? They are situated so near our strict line of search, that it is worth our while to ascertain if there be on them any trace of the shipwreck of the Britannia.\" \"The unbeliever!\" said Paganel. \"I do not want to have to return to them, monsieur, if Australia does not after all realize our newly-conceived expectations.\" \"The precaution is not a bad one,\" said Glenarvan. [Illustration: At sunrise they saw the conical peak of Tristan, seemingly separated from all the rest of the rocky group.] [Illustration: A few hours of their united toil resulted in the death of a large number of seals who were \"caught napping.\"] \"And I do not wish to dissuade you; quite the contrary,\" replied the geographer. \"Well, then, we will adopt it, and start forthwith,\" said Lord Glenarvan. \"Immediately, my lord,\" replied the captain, as he went on deck, while Robert and Mary Grant uttered the liveliest expressions of gratitude; and the Duncan, leaving the American coast and heading to the east, was soon swiftly ploughing the waves of the Atlantic. CHAPTER XXVIII. TRISTAN D'ACUNHA AND THE ISLE OF AMSTERDAM. [Sidenote: LOOKING ALOFT.] The Duncan now had before her a broad stretch of ocean but little traversed by navigators. Between the shores of South America and the little speck in the ocean known by the name of Tristan d'Acunha, there was no probability of her meeting with any strange sail; and under some circumstances, or in some company, the days might have been monotonous and the hours might have hung wearily. But so ardent was the desire for success, and so accomplished, yet varied, were the characters of those who composed the little assembly, that the voyage on the South Atlantic, though devoid of striking incident, was by no means wanting in interest. Much of the time was spent on deck, where the ladies' cabins were now located, Mary Grant especially training her hand, head, and heart in feeling, thought, and action. The geographer set to work on a composition entitled \"Travels of a Geographer on the Argentine Pampas;\" but many a blank page did he leave. Tho Scottish peer (when tired of examining for the thousandth time all that belonged to his yacht) could look at the books and documents which he had brought with him, intending to peruse them carefully. And as to the major he was never in company and never out of company; his cigar insured, nothing else was wanted. Ever and anon many miles of the ocean would be covered by masses of sea-weed; these different species of algæ would afford subject for research; specimens must be preserved, authorities must be consulted, and as one result at least all would become wiser. Then a discussion would ensue on some geographical problem, and maps that were not attainable were of course appealed to by each disputant, though the subject in question was often of very trivial moment. It was in the midst of a debate of this kind, during the evening, that a sailor cried out,-- \"Land ahead!\" \"In what direction?\" asked Paganel. \"To windward,\" replied the sailor. The landsmen's eyes were strained, but to no purpose",

[Illustration: More than once during the journey, the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage.] In the meantime, Paganel had asked Glenarvan for the document, by relying on which their search had resulted so unfortunately. He read it again with unconcealed vexation, seeking to discover a new interpretation. \"This document is, at all events, clear,\" said Glenarvan. \"It explains in the most definite manner the shipwreck of the captain and the place of his captivity.\" \"No,\" replied the geographer, stamping with his foot, \"a hundred times no! Since Captain Grant is not on the Pampas, he is not in America. This document ought to tell where he is; and it shall, my friends, or I am no longer Jacques Paganel.\" CHAPTER XXII. THE FLOOD. [Sidenote: OMENS AND MIRAGES.] Fort Independence is one hundred and fifty miles from the shores of the Atlantic. But for unforeseen and unexpected delays, Glenarvan could have rejoined the Duncan in four days. He could not, however, reconcile himself to the idea of returning on board without Captain Grant, and failing so completely in his search; and did not therefore, as usual, give the orders for departure. But the major assumed the task of saddling the horses, renewing the provisions, and making his arrangements for the journey. Thanks to his activity, the little party, at eight o'clock in the morning, was on its way down the grassy slopes of the Tandil Sierra. Glenarvan, with Robert at his side, galloped on in silence. His lordship's bold and resolute character did not permit him to accept this disappointment calmly. His heart beat violently, and his brain was on fire. Paganel, tormented by the mystery of the document, arranged the words in every way, as if to draw from them a new meaning. Thalcave silently resigned himself to Thaouka's sagacity. The major, always confident, performed his duties like a man upon whom discouragement can have no effect. Tom Austin and his two sailors shared their master's annoyance. Once, when a timid hare crossed the path in front of them, the superstitious Scotchmen gazed at one another. \"A bad omen,\" said Wilson. \"Yes, in the Highlands,\" replied Mulready. \"What is bad in the Highlands is no better here,\" added Wilson, sententiously. About noon the travelers had descended the mountains and gained the undulating plains that extend to the sea; the boundless prairie spread its broad carpet of verdure before them. More than once during the journey the attention and interest of all, but especially of Paganel, were arrested by the curious illusion of the mirage, by which was presented in the sky, at the limits of the horizon, a semblance of the estancias, the poplars and willows near them, and other objects; the images being so much like the reality that it required a strong effort to realize their deceptive character. The weather hitherto had been fine, but now the sky assumed a less pleasing aspect. Masses of vapor, generated by the high temperature of the preceding days, condensed into thick clouds and threatened to dissolve in showers of rain. Moreover, the proximity of the Atlantic, and the west wind, which here reigns supreme, rendered the climate of this region peculiarly moist. However, for that day at least the heavy clouds did not break; and at evening the horses, after traveling forty miles, halted on the edge of a deep \"cañada,\" an immense natural ditch filled with water. A shelter was wanting, but the ponchos served for tents as well as clothing, and peaceful slumbers enwrapped all. The next day, as they progressed farther, the presence of subterranean streams betrayed itself more noticeably, and moisture was seen in every depression of the ground. Soon they came to large ponds, some already deep and others just forming. So long as there were only lagoons, the horses could easily extricate themselves; but with these treacherous swamps it was more difficult. Tall grass obstructed them, and it was necessary to incur the danger before it could be understood. These quagmires had been already fatal to more than one human being. Robert, who had ridden half a mile in advance, returned at a gallop, crying,-- \"Monsieur Paganel! Monsieur Paganel! A forest of horns!\" \"What!\" replied the geographer, \"have you found a forest of horns?\" \"Yes, yes; or at least a field.\" \"A field! you are dreaming, my boy,\" said Paganel, shrugging his shoulders. \"I am not dreaming,\" retorted Robert; \"you shall see for yourself. This is a strange country! People sow horns, and they spring up like corn! I should like very well to have some of the seed.\" \"But he speaks seriously,\" said the major. \"Yes, major, you shall see.\" Robert was not mistaken, and soon they found themselves before a vast field of horns, regularly planted. \"Well?\" said Robert. \"This is something singular,\" replied Paganel, turning towards the Indian with a questioning look. [Sidenote: AN ANXIOUS INDIAN.] \"The horns come from the ground,\" explained Thalcave; \"and the cattle are under it.\" \"What!\" cried Paganel, \"is there a whole drove in this mire?\" \"Yes,\" answered the Patagonian. In fact, a vast herd had perished in this bog, which had given way beneath them. Hundreds of cattle had thus met their death, side by side, by suffocation in this vast quagmire. This circumstance, which sometimes takes place on the plains, could not be ignored by the Indian, and it was a warning which it was proper to heed. They passed around this immense hecatomb, which would have satisfied the most exacting gods of antiquity; and an hour after the field of horns was far behind. Thalcave now began to observe with an anxious air the state of things around him. He frequently stopped, and rose in his stirrups. His tall form enabled him to survey a wide range; but, perceiving nothing that could enlighten him, he resumed his undeviating course. A mile farther, he stopped again, and, turning from the beaten track, proceeded a short distance, first to the north, then to the south, and then resumed his place at the head of the party, without saying either what he hoped or what he feared. These manoeuvres, many times repeated,",

      "text": " He held in his hand the letter written by Paganel, and signed by Glenarvan. \"Read it, my lord,\" said the old sailor. Glenarvan took the letter, and read: \"Order for Tom Austin to put to sea, and bring the Duncan to the eastern coast of New Zealand.\" \"New Zealand?\" cried Paganel, starting. He snatched the letter from Glenarvan's hands, rubbed his eyes, adjusted his spectacles to his nose, and read in his turn. \"New Zealand!\" repeated he, in an indescribable tone, while the letter slipped from his fingers. Just then he felt a hand fall upon his shoulder. He turned, and found himself face to face with the major. [Sidenote: PAGANEL IN THE WITNESS-BOX.] \"Well, my good Paganel,\" said MacNabb, in a grave tone, \"it is fortunate that you did not send the Duncan to Cochin-China.\" This sally finished the poor geographer. A fit of laughter seized the whole crew. Paganel, as if mad, ran to and fro, holding his head in his hands, and tearing his hair. However, when he had recovered from his frenzy, there was still another unavoidable question to answer. \"Now, Paganel,\" said Glenarvan, \"be candid. I acknowledge that your absent-mindedness has been providential. To be sure, without you the Duncan would have fallen into the hands of the convicts; without you we should have been recaptured by the Maoris. But do tell me, what strange association of ideas, what unnatural aberration, induced you to write New Zealand instead of Australia?\" \"Very well,\" said Paganel. \"It was----\" But at that moment his eyes fell upon Robert and Mary Grant, and he stopped short, finally replying: \"Never mind, my dear Glenarvan. I am a madman, a fool, an incorrigible being, and shall die a most famous blunderer!\" The affair was no longer discussed. The mystery of the Duncan's presence there was solved; and the travelers, so miraculously saved, thought only of revisiting their comfortable cabins and partaking of a good breakfast. However, leaving Lady Helena, Mary Grant, the major, Paganel, and Robert to enter the saloon, Glenarvan and Captain Mangles retained Tom Austin with them. They wished to question him further. \"Now, Tom,\" said Glenarvan, \"let me know: did not this order to sail for the coast of New Zealand seem strange to you?\" \"Yes, my lord,\" replied Austin. \"I was very much surprised; but, as I am not in the habit of discussing the orders I receive, I obeyed. Could I act otherwise? If any accident had happened from not following your instructions, should I not have been to blame? Would you have done differently, captain?\" \"No, Tom,\" answered Captain Mangles. \"But what did you think?\" asked Glenarvan. \"I thought, my lord, that, in the cause of Captain Grant, it was necessary to go wherever you directed me; that by some combination of circumstances another vessel would take you to New Zealand, and that I was to wait for you on the eastern coast of the island. Moreover, on leaving Melbourne, I kept my destination secret, and the crew did not know it till we were out at sea and the shores of Australia had disappeared from sight. But then an incident occurred that perplexed me very much.\" \"What do you mean, Tom?\" inquired Glenarvan. \"I mean,\" he replied, \"that when the quartermaster, Ayrton, learned, the day after our departure, the Duncan's destination----\" \"Ayrton!\" cried Glenarvan. \"Is he on board?\" \"Yes, my lord.\" \"Ayrton here!\" repeated Glenarvan, glancing at Captain Mangles. \"Wonderful indeed!\" said the young captain. In an instant, with the swiftness of lightning, Ayrton's conduct, his long-contrived treachery, Glenarvan's wound, the attack upon Mulready, their sufferings in the marshes of the Snowy, all the wretch's deeds, flashed upon the minds of the two men. And now, by a strange fatality, the convict was in their power. \"Where is he?\" asked Glenarvan quickly. \"In a cabin in the forecastle,\" replied Tom Austin, \"closely guarded.\" \"Why this confinement?\" [Sidenote: AN UNOFFICIAL TRIBUNAL.] \"Because, when Ayrton saw that the yacht was sailing for New Zealand, he flew into a passion; because he attempted to force me to change the ship's course; because he threatened me; and, finally, because he urged my men to a mutiny. I saw that he was a dangerous person, and was compelled, therefore, to take precautions against him.\" \"And since that time?\" \"Since that time he has been in his cabin, without offering to come out.\" \"Good!\" At this moment Glenarvan and Captain Mangles were summoned to the saloon. Breakfast, which they so much needed, was ready. They took seats at the table, but did not speak of Ayrton. However, when the meal was ended, and the passengers had assembled on deck, Glenarvan informed them of the quartermaster's presence on board. At the same time he declared his intention of sending for him. \"Can I be released from attending this tribunal?\" asked Lady Helena. \"I confess to you, my dear Edward, that the sight of this unfortunate would be very painful to me.\" \"It is only to confront him, Helena,\" replied Glenarvan. \"Remain, if you can. Ben Joyce should see himself face to face with all his intended victims.\" Lady Helena yielded to this request, and Mary Grant and she took their places beside him, while around them stood the major, Paganel, Captain Mangles, Robert, Wilson, Mulready, and Olbinett, all who had suffered so severely by the convict's treason. The crew of the yacht, who did not yet understand the seriousness of these proceedings, maintained a profound silence. \"Call Ayrton!\" said Glenarvan. CHAPTER LVI. AYRTON'S OBSTINACY. Ayrton soon made his appearance. He crossed the deck with a confident step, and ascended the poop-stairs. His eyes had a sullen look, his teeth were set, and his fists clinched convulsively. His bearing displayed neither exultation nor humility. As soon as he was in Lord Glenarvan's presence, he folded his arms,",
